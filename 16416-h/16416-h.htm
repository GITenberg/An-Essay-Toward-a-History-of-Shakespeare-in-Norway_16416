<h1>PREFATORY NOTE</h1>

<p>I have attempted in this study to trace the history of Shakespearean
translations, Shakespearean criticism, and the performances
of Shakespeare's plays in Norway. I have not attempted
to investigate Shakespeare's influence on Norwegian literature.
To do so would not, perhaps, be entirely fruitless, but it would
constitute a different kind of work.</p>

<p>The investigation was made possible by a fellowship from the
University of Chicago and a scholarship from the American-Scandinavian
Foundation, and I am glad to express my gratitude to
these bodies for the opportunities given to me of study in the
Scandinavian countries. I am indebted for special help and
encouragement to Dr. C.N. Gould and Professor J.M. Manly,
of the University of Chicago, and to the authorities of the University
library in Kristiania for their unfailing courtesy. To my
wife, who has worked with me throughout, my obligations are
greater than I can express.</p>

<p>It is my plan to follow this monograph with a second on the history of
Shakespeare in Denmark.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER I</h1>

<h2>Shakespeare Translations in Norway</h2>

<h2>A</h2>

<p>In the years following 1750, there was gathered in the city
of Trondhjem a remarkable group of men: Nils Krog Bredal,
composer of the first Danish opera, John Gunnerus, theologian
and biologist, Gerhart Schøning, rector of the Cathedral School
and author of an elaborate history of the fatherland, and Peter
Suhm, whose 14,047 pages on the history of Denmark testify
to a learning, an industry, and a generous devotion to scholarship
which few have rivalled. Bredal was mayor (Borgermester),
Gunnerus was bishop, Schøning was rector, and Suhm was for
the moment merely the husband of a rich and unsympathetic
wife. But they were united in their interest in serious studies,
and in 1760, the last three&mdash;somewhat before Bredal's
arrival&mdash;founded "Videnskabsselkabet i Trondhjem."
A few years later the society received its charter as
"Det Kongelige Videnskabsselskab."</p>

<p>A little provincial scientific body! Of what moment is it?
But in those days it was of moment. Norway was then and long
afterwards the political and intellectual dependency of Denmark.
For three hundred years she had been governed more or less effectively
from Copenhagen, and for two hundred years Danish had
supplanted Norwegian as the language of church and state, of
trade, and of higher social intercourse. The country had no
university; Norwegians were compelled to go to Copenhagen for
their degrees and there loaf about in the anterooms of ministers
waiting for preferment. Videnskabsselskabet was the first
tangible evidence of awakened national life, and we are not surprised
to find that it was in this circle that the demand for a
separate Norwegian university was first authoritatively presented.
Again, a little group of periodicals sprang up in which were discussed,
learnedly and pedantically, to be sure, but with keen
intelligence, the questions that were interesting the great world
outside. It is dreary business ploughing through these solemn,
badly printed octavos and quartos. Of a sudden, however, one
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
comes upon the first, and for thirty-six years the only Norwegian
translation of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>We find it in <i>Trondhjems Allehaande</i> for October 23,
1782&mdash;the third and last volume. The translator has hit upon
Antony's funeral oration and introduces it with a short
note:<a name = "tag1_1" href = "#note1_1"><sup>I.1</sup></a>
"The following is taken from the famous English play <i>Julius Caesar</i>
and may be regarded as a masterpiece. When Julius Caesar
was killed, Antonius secured permission from Brutus and the other
conspirators to speak at his funeral. The people, whose minds were
full of the prosperity to come, were satisfied with Caesar's murder
and regarded the murderers as benefactors. Antonius spoke
so as to turn their minds from rejoicing to regret at a great man's
untimely death and so as to justify himself and win the hearts of
the populace. And in what a masterly way Antonius won them!
We shall render, along with the oration, the interjected remarks
of the crowd, inasmuch as they too are evidences of Shakespeare's
understanding of the human soul and his realization of the manner
in which the oration gradually brought about the purpose toward
which he aimed:"</p>

<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Antonius:</span>
Venner, Medborgere, giver mig Gehør, jeg kommer for at jorde
Cæsars Legeme, ikke for at rose ham. Det Onde man gjør lever endnu efter
os; det Gode begraves ofte tilligemed vore Been. Saa Være det ogsaa med
Cæsar. Den ædle Brutus har sagt Eder, Cæsar var herskesyg. Var han det
saa var det en svær Forseelse: og Cæsar har ogsaa dyrt maattet bøde
derfor. Efter Brutus og de Øvriges Tilladelse&mdash;og Brutus er en
hederlig Mand, og det er de alle, lutter hederlige Mænd, kommer jeg hid
for at holde Cæsars Ligtale. Han var min Ven, trofast og oprigtig mod
mig! dog, Brutus siger, han var herskesyg, og Brutus er en hederlig Mand.
Han har bragt mange Fanger med til Rom, hvis Løsepenge formerede de
offentlige Skatter; synes Eder det herskesygt af Cæsar&mdash;naar de Arme
skreeg, saa græd Cæsar&mdash;Herskesyge maate dog vel væves af stærkere
Stof.&mdash;Dog Brutus siger han var herskesyg; og Brutus er en hederlig
Mand. I have alle seet at jeg paa Pans Fest tre Gange tilbød ham en
kongelig Krone, og at han tre Gange afslog den. Var det
herskesygt?&mdash;Dog Brutus siger han var herskesyg, og i Sandhed, han
er en hederlig Mand. Jeg taler ikke for at gjendrive det, som Brutus har
sagt; men jeg staar her, for at sige hvad jeg veed. I alle elskede ham
engang, uden Aarsag; hvad for <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'an'">en</ins> Aarsag afholder Eder fra at sørge
over ham? O! Fornuft! Du er flyed hen til de umælende Bæster, og
Menneskene have tabt deres Forstand. Haver Taalmodighed med mig; mit
Hjerte er hist i Kisten hos Cæsar, og jeg maa holde inde til det kommer
tilbage til mig.

Endnu i Gaar havde et Ord af Cæsar gjældt imod hele Verden, nu ligger han
der, endog den Usleste nægter ham Agtelse. O, I Folk! var jeg sindet, at
ophidse Eders Gemytter til Raserie og Oprør, saa skulde jeg skade Brutus
og Kassius, hvilke, som I alle veed, ere hederlige Mænd. Men jeg vil
intet Ondt gjøre dem: hellere vil jeg gjøre den Døde, mig selv, og Eder
Uret, end at jeg skulde volde slige hederlige Mænd Fortræd. Men her er et
Pergament med Cæsars Segl: jeg fandt det i hans Kammer; det er hans
sidste Villie. Lad Folket blot høre hans Testament, som jeg, tilgiv mig
det, ikke tænker at oplæse, da skulde de alle gaa hen og kysse den døde
Cæsars Saar; og dyppe deres Klæder i hans hellige Blod; skulde bede om et
Haar af ham til Erindring, og paa deres Dødsdag i deres sidste Villie
tænke paa dette Haar, og testamentere deres Efterkommere det som en rig
Arvedel.
</div>
<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Den Fjerde:</span>
Vi ville høre Testamentet! Læs det, Marcus Antonius.
</div>
<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Antonius:</span>
Haver Taalmodighed, mine Venner: jeg tør ikke forelæse det; deter ikke
raadeligt, at I erfare hvor kjær Cæsar havde Eder. I ere ikke Træe,
I ere ikke Stene, I ere Mennesker; og da I ere Mennesker saa skulde
Testamentet, om I hørte det, sætte Eder i Flamme, det skulde gjøre Eder
rasende. Det er godt at I ikke vide, at I ere hans Arvinger; thi vidste
I det, O, hvad vilde der da blive af?
</div>
<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Den fjerde:</span>
Læs Testamentet; vi ville høre det, Antonius! Du maae læse

</div>
<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Antonius:</span>
Ville i være rolige? Ville I bie lidt? Jeg er gaaen for vidt
at jeg har sagt Eder noget derom&mdash;jeg frygter jeg fornærmer de
hederlige Mænd, som have myrdet Cæsar&mdash;jeg befrygter det.
</div>
<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Den Fjerde:</span>
De vare Forrædere!&mdash;ha, hederlige Mænd!
</div>

<p>The translation continues to the point where the plebeians,
roused to fury by the cunning appeal of Antony, rush out with
the cries:<a name = "tag1_2" href = "#note1_2"><sup>I.2</sup></a></p>

<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">2. Pleb:</span>

<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">2. Pleb:</span>
Plucke down Formes, Windowes, anything.
</div>

<p>But we have not space for a more extended quotation, and the
passage given is sufficiently representative.</p>

<p>The faults are obvious. The translator has not ventured
to reproduce Shakespeare's blank verse, nor, indeed, could that
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
be expected. The Alexandrine had long held sway in Danish
poetry. In <i>Rolf Krage</i> (1770), Ewald had broken with the tradition
and written an heroic tragedy in prose. Unquestionably he
had been moved to take this step by the example of his great model
Klopstock in <i>Bardiete</i>.<a name = "tag1_3"
href = "#note1_3"><sup>I.3</sup></a>
It seems equally certain, however,
that he was also inspired by the plays of Shakespeare, and the
songs of Ossian, which came to him in the translations of
Wieland.<a name = "tag1_4" href = "#note1_4"><sup>I.4</sup></a></p>

<p>A few years later, when he had learned English and read Shakespeare
in the original, he wrote <i>Balders Død</i> in blank verse and
naturalized Shakespeare's metre in Denmark.<a name = "tag1_5"
href = "#note1_5"><sup>I.5</sup></a> At any rate, it
is not surprising that this unknown plodder far north in Trondhjem
had not progressed beyond Klopstock and Ewald. But
the result of turning Shakespeare's poetry into the journeyman
prose of a foreign language is necessarily bad. The translation
before us amounts to a paraphrase,&mdash;good, respectable Danish
untouched by genius. Two examples will illustrate this. The
lines:</p>

<div class = "verse">
.... Now lies he there,<br>
And none so poor to do him reverence.
</div>

<p>are rendered in the thoroughly matter-of-fact words, appropriate
for a letter or a newspaper "story":</p>

<div class = "verse">
.... Nu ligger han der,<br>
endog den Usleste nægter ham Agtelse.
</div>

<p>Again,</p>

<div class = "verse">
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it,
</div>

<p>is translated:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Jeg er gaaen for vidt at jeg sagde Eder noget derom.
</div>

<p>On the other hand, the translation presents no glaring errors;
such slips as we do find are due rather to ineptitude, an inability
to find the right word, with the result that the writer has contented
himself with an accidental and approximate rendering. For example,
the translator no doubt understood the lines:</p>

<div class = "verse">
The evil that men do lives after them,<br>
The good is oft interred with their bones.
</div>

<p>but he could hit upon nothing better than:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Det Onde man gjør <i>lever endnu efter os</i>;<br>
det Gode begraves ofte tilligemed vore Been.
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<p>which is both inaccurate and infelicitous. For the line</p>

<div class = "verse">
He was my friend, faithful and just to me.
</div>

<p>our author has:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Han var min Ven, trofast og <i>oprigtig</i> mod mig!
</div>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class = "speech">
Has he, Masters? I fear there will come a worse in his place.
</div>

<p>Translation:</p>

<div class = "speech">
Mener I det, godt Folk?&mdash;etc.
</div>

<p>Despite these faults&mdash;and many others could be cited,&mdash;it is
perfectly
clear that this unknown student of Shakespeare understood
his original and endeavored to reproduce it correctly in good
Danish. His very blunders showed that he tried not to be slavish,
and his style, while not remarkable, is easy and fluent.
Apparently, however, his work attracted no attention. His name
is unknown, as are his sources, and there is not, with one exception,
a single reference to him in the later Shakespeare literature
of Denmark and Norway. Not even Rahbek, who was remarkably
well informed in this field, mentions him.
Only Foersom,<a name = "tag1_6" href = "#note1_6"><sup>I.6</sup></a>
who let nothing referring to Shakespeare escape him, speaks
(in the notes to Part I of his translation) of a part of Act III of
<i>Julius Caesar</i> in <i>Trondhjems Allehaande</i>. That is all. It it
not too much to emphasize, therefore, that we have here the first
Danish version of any part of <i>Julius Caesar</i> as well as the first
Norwegian translation of any part of Shakespeare into what was
then the common literary language of Denmark and
Norway.<a name = "tag1_7" href = "#note1_7"><sup>I.7</sup></a>*</p>


<h2>B</h2>

<p>It was many years before the anonymous contributor to
<i>Trondhjems Allehaande</i> was to have a follower. From 1782
to 1807 Norwegians were engaged in accumulating wealth, an
occupation, indeed, in which they were remarkably successful.
There was no time to meddle with Shakespeare in a day when
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
Norwegian shipping and Norwegian products were profitable as
never before. After 1807, when the blundering panic of the British
plunged Denmark and Norway into war on the side of Napoleon,
there were sterner things to think of. It was a sufficiently
difficult matter to get daily bread. But in 1818, when the country
had, as yet, scarcely begun to recover from the agony of the
Napoleonic wars, the second Norwegian translation from Shakespeare
appeared.<a name = "tag1_8" href = "#note1_8"><sup>I.8</sup></a></p>

<p>The translator of this version of <i>Coriolanus</i> is unknown.
Beyond the bare statement on the title page that the translation
is made directly from Shakespeare and that it is printed and published
in Christiania by Jacob Lehmann, there is no information
to be had. Following the title there is a brief quotation from Dr.
Johnson and one from the "Zeitung für die elegante Welt."
Again Norway anticipates her sister nation; for not till the
following year did Denmark get her first translation of the
play.<a name = "tag1_9" href = "#note1_9"><sup>I.9</sup></a></p>

<p>Ewald, <ins class = "correction"
title = "variant spellings in original">Oehlenschlæger</ins>,
and Foersom had by this time made
the blank verse of Shakespeare a commonplace in Dano-Norwegian
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
literature. Even the mediocre could attempt it with
reasonable assurance of success. The <i>Coriolanus</i> of 1818 is
fairly correct, but its lumbering verse reveals plainly that the
translator had trouble with his metre. Two or three examples
will illustrate. First, the famous allegory of
Menenius:<a name = "tag1_10" href = "#note1_10"><sup>I.10</sup></a></p>

<div class = "verse">

<p>Aside from the preponderance of feminine endings, which is
inevitable in Scandinavian blank verse, what strikes us most in
this translation is its laboriousness. The language is set on end.
Inversion and transposition are the devices by which the translator
has managed to give Shakespeare in metrically decent lines.
The proof of this is so patent that I need scarcely point out instances.
But take the first seven lines of the quotation. Neither
in form nor content is this bad, yet no one with a feeling for the
Danish language can avoid an exclamation, "forskruet Stil"
and "poetiske Stylter." And lines 8-9 smack unmistakably
of <i>Peder Paars</i>. In the second place, the translator often does
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
not attempt to translate at all. He gives merely a paraphrase.
Compare lines 1-3 with the English original; the whole of the
speech of the first citizen, 17-24, 25-27, where the whole implied
idea is fully expressed; 28-30, etc., etc. We might offer almost
every translation of Shakespeare's figures as an example. One
more instance. At times even paraphrase breaks down. Compare</p>

<p>This is not even good paraphrase; it is simply bald and helpless
rendering.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it would be grossly unfair to dismiss it
all with a sneer. The translator has succeeded for the most
part in giving the sense of Shakespeare in smooth and sounding
verse, in itself no small achievement. Rhetoric replaces poetry,
it is true, and paraphrase dries up the freshness and the sparkle
of the metaphor. But a Norwegian of that day who got his first
taste of Shakespeare from the translation before us, would at
least feel that here was the power of words, the music and sonorousness
of elevated dramatic poetry.</p>

<p>In 1865, Paul Botten Hansen, best known to the English-speaking
world for his relations with Bjørnson and Ibsen,
reviewed<a name = "tag1_11" href = "#note1_11"><sup>I.11</sup></a>
the eleventh installment of Lembcke's translation of Shakespeare.
The article does not venture into criticism, but is almost entirely
a resumé of Shakespeare translation in Norway and Denmark.
It is less well informed than we should expect, and contains, among
several other slips, the following "...in 1855, Niels Hauge,
deceased the following year as teacher in Kragerø, translated
<i>Macbeth</i>, the first faithful version of this masterpiece
which Dano-Norwegian literature could boast of." Botten Hansen mentions
only one previous Danish or Norwegian version of
Shakespeare&mdash;Foersom's
adaptation of Schiller's stage version (1816). He is
quite obviously ignorant of Rosenfeldt's translation of 1790; and
the Rahbek-Sanders translation of 1801 seems also to have escaped
him, although Hauge expressly refers to this work in his introduction.
Both of these early attempts are in prose; Foersom's, to be sure, is in
blank verse, but Foersom's <i>Macbeth</i> is not Shakespeare's.
Accordingly, it is, in a sense, true that Hauge in 1855 did give the
Dano-Norwegian public their first taste of an unspoiled <i>Macbeth</i>
in the vernacular.<a name = "tag1_12"
href = "#note1_12"><sup>I.12</sup></a></p>

<p>Hauge tells us that he had interested himself in English literature
at the risk of being called an eccentric. Modern languages
then offered no avenue to preferment, and why, forsooth, did men
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
attend lectures and take examinations except to gain the means of
earning a livelihood? He justifies his interest, however, by the
seriousness and industry with which Shakespeare is studied in
Germany and England. With the founts of this study he is
apparently familiar, and with the influence of Shakespeare on
Lessing, Goethe, and the lesser romanticists. It is interesting
to note, too, that two scholars, well known in widely different
fields, Monrad, the philosopher&mdash;for some years a sort of Dr.
Johnson in the literary circles of Christiania&mdash;and Unger, the
scholarly editor of many Old Norse texts, assisted him in his work.</p>

<p>The character of Hauge's work is best seen in his notes. They
consist of a careful defense of every liberty he takes with the text,
explanations of grammatical constructions, and interpretations of
debated matters. For example, he defends the witches on the
ground that they symbolize the power of evil in the human soul.</p>

<blockquote>
Man kan sige at Shakespeare i dem og deres Slæng har givet de
nytestamentlige Dæmoner Kjød og Blod.
</blockquote>

<p>(We may say that Shakespeare in them and their train has endowed
the demons of the New Testament with flesh and blood).
Again, he would change the word <i>incarnadine</i> to <i>incarnate</i>
on the ground that <i>Twelfth Night V</i> offers a similar instance of
the corrupt use of <i>incardinate</i> for <i>incarnate</i>. The word
occurs, moreover, in English only in this passage.<a name = "tag1_13"
href = "#note1_13"><sup>I.13</sup></a> Again, in his note to
Act IV, he points out that the dialogue in which Malcolm tests
the sincerity of Macduff is taken almost verbatim from Holinshed.
"In performing the play," he suggests, "it should, perhaps,
be omitted as it very well may be without injury to the
action since the complication which arises through Malcolm's
suspicion of Macduff is fully and satisfactorily resolved by the
appearance of Rosse." And his note to a passage in Act V is
interesting as showing that, wide and thorough as was Hauge's
acquaintance with Shakespearean criticism, he had, besides, a
first-hand knowledge of the minor Elizabethan dramatists. I
give the note in full. "<i>The way to dusty death&mdash;</i></p>

<blockquote>
Til dette besynderlige Udtryk, kan foruden hvad Knight og Dyce have at

</blockquote>

<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<p>Hauge was a careful and conscientious scholar. He knew
his field and worked with the painstaking fidelity of the man who
realizes the difficulty of his task. The translation he gave is of
a piece with the man&mdash;faithful, laborious, uninspired. But it
is, at least, superior to Rosenfeldt and Sander, and Hauge justified
his work by giving to his countrymen the best version of
<i>Macbeth</i> up to that time.</p>

<p>Monrad himself reviewed Hauge's <i>Macbeth</i> in a careful and
well-informed article, in <i>Nordisk Tidsskrift for Videnskab og
Literatur</i>, which I shall review later.</p>


<h2>D</h2>

<p>One of the most significant elements in the intellectual life
of modern Norway is the so-called Landsmaal movement. It
is probably unnecessary to say that this movement is an effort on
the part of many Norwegians to substitute for the dominant Dano-Norwegian
a new literary language based on the "best" dialects.
This language, commonly called the Landsmaal, is, at all events
in its origin, the creation of one man, Ivar Aasen. Aasen published
the first edition of his grammar in 1848, and the first edition
of his dictionary in 1850. But obviously it was not enough to
provide a grammar and a word-book. The literary powers of
the new language must be developed and disciplined and, accordingly,
Aasen published in 1853 <i>Prøver af Landsmaalet i Norge</i>.
The little volume contains, besides other material, seven translations
from foreign classics; among these is Romeo's soliloquy
in the balcony scene.<a name = "tag1_14"
href = "#note1_14"><sup>I.14</sup></a> (Act II, Sc. 1) This modest
essay of Aasen's, then, antedates Hauge's rendering of <i>Macbeth</i>
and constitutes the first bit of Shakespeare translation in Norway since
the <i>Coriolanus</i> of 1818.</p>

<p>Aasen knew that Landsmaal was adequate to the expression
of the homely and familiar. But would it do for belles lettres?</p>

<p>It was no peasant jargon that Aasen had invented; it was a
literary language of great power and beauty with the dignity and
fulness of any other literary medium. But it was new and untried.
It had no literature. Aasen, accordingly, set about creating
one. Indeed, much of what he wrote had no other purpose.
What, then, shall we say of the first appearance of Shakespeare
in "Ny Norsk"?</p>

<p>First, that it was remarkably felicitous.</p>

<div class = "verse">
Kinn-Ljosken hadde skemt dei <ins class = "correction"

</div>

<p>That is no inadequate rendering of:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Two of the fairest stars in all the Heaven, etc.
</div>

<p>And equally good are the closing lines beginning:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Aa tala meir, Ljos-Engel med du lyser, etc.
</div>

<p>Foersom is deservedly praised for his translation of the same
lines, but a comparison of the two is not altogether disastrous to
Aasen, though, to be sure, his lines lack some of Foersom's insinuating
softness:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<div class = "verse">
Tal atter, Lysets Engel! thi du straaler<br>
i Natten saa høiherlig over mig<br>
som en af Nattens vingede Cheruber<br>

</div>

<p>But lines like these have an admirable and perfect loveliness:</p>

<div class = "verse">
naar han skrid um dan seinleg-sigand' Skyi<br>
og sigler yver høge Himmels Barmen.
</div>

<p>Aasen busied himself for some years with this effort to naturalize
his Landsmaal in all the forms of literature. Apparently
this was always uppermost in his thoughts. We find him trying
himself in this sort of work in the years before and after the
publication
of <i>Prøver af Landsmaalet</i>. In <i>Skrifter i Samling</i> is printed
another little fragment of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, which the editor,
without giving his reasons, assigns to a date earlier than that of
the balcony scene. It is Mercutio's description of Queen Mab
(Act I, Sc. 4). This is decidedly more successful than the other.
The vocabulary of the Norwegian dialects is rich in words of
fairy-lore, and one who knew this word treasure as Aasen did could
render the fancies of Mercutio with something very near the exuberance
of Shakespeare himself:</p>

<div class = "verse">

</div>

<p>The translation ends with Mercutio's words:</p>

<div class = "verse">
And being thus frightened, swears a prayer or two,<br>
And sleeps again.
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<p>In my opinion this is consummately well done&mdash;at once accurate
and redolent of poesy; and certainly Aasen would have been
justified in feeling that Landsmaal is equal to Shakespeare's
most airy passages. The slight inaccuracy of one of the lines:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Av Maanestraalanne paa Vatn er Selen,
</div>

<p>for Shakespeare's:</p>

<div class = "verse">
The colors of the moonshine's watery beams,
</div>

<p>is of no consequence. The discrepancy was doubtless as obvious
to the translator as it is to us.</p>

<p>From about the same time we have another Shakespeare fragment
from Aasen's hand. Like the Queen Mab passage, it was
not published till 1911.<a name = "tag1_16"
href = "#note1_16"><sup>I.16</sup></a>
It is scarcely surprising that it is a
rendering of Hamlet's soliloquy: "To be or not to be." This
is, of course, a more difficult undertaking. For the interests
that make up the life of the people&mdash;their family and community
affairs, their arts and crafts and folk-lore, the dialects of Norway,
like the dialects of any other country, have a vocabulary amazingly
rich and complete.<a name = "tag1_17"
href = "#note1_17"><sup>I.17</sup></a> But
not all ideas belong in the realm of the
every-day, and the great difficulty of the Landsmaal movement
is precisely this&mdash;that it must develop a "culture language."
To a large degree it has already done so. The rest is largely a
matter of time. And surely Ivar Aasen's translation of the famous
soliloquy proved that the task of giving, even to thought as

as this, adequate and final expression is not impossible. The
whole is worth giving:</p>

<p>This is a distinctly successful attempt&mdash;exact, fluent, poetic.
Compare it with the Danish of Foersom and Lembcke, with the
Swedish of Hagberg, or the new Norwegian "Riksmaal" translation,
and Ivar Aasen's early Landsmaal version holds its own. It
keeps the right tone. The dignity of the original is scarcely
marred by a note of the colloquial. Scarcely marred! For just
as many Norwegians are offended by such a phrase as "Hennar
Taus er fagrar' en ho sjølv" in the balcony scene, so many more
will object to the colloquial "Au, d'er Knuten." <i>Au</i> has no
place in dignified verse, and surely it is a most unhappy equivalent
for "Ay, there's the rub." Aasen would have replied that Hamlet's
words are themselves colloquial; but the English conveys no
such connotation of easy speech as does the Landsmaal to a great
part of the Norwegian people. But this is a trifle. The fact
remains that Aasen gave a noble form to Shakespeare's noble
verse.</p>


<h2>E</h2>

<p>For many years the work of Hauge and Aasen stood alone in
Norwegian literature. The reading public was content to go to
Denmark, and the growing Landsmaal literature was concerned
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
with other matters&mdash;first of all, with the task of establishing
itself and the even more complicated problem of finding
a form&mdash;orthography,
syntax, and inflexions which should command general
acceptance. For the Landsmaal of Ivar Aasen was frankly
based on "the best dialects," and by this he meant, of course, the
dialects that best preserved the forms of the Old Norse. These
were the dialects of the west coast and the mountains. To Aasen
the speech of the towns, of the south-east coast and of the great
eastern valleys and uplands was corrupt and vitiated. It seemed
foreign, saturated and spoiled by Danish. There were those,
however, who saw farther. If Landsmaal was to strike root,
it must take into account not merely "the purest dialects" but
the speech of the whole country. It could not, for example,
retain forms like "dat," "dan," etc., which were peculiar to
Søndmør, because they happened to be lineal descendants of Old
Norse, nor should it insist on preterites in <i>ade</i> and participles
in
<i>ad</i> merely because these forms were found in the sagas. We cannot
enter upon this subject; we can but point out that this movement
was born almost with Landsmaal itself, and that, after
Aasen's fragments, the first Norwegian translation of any part
of Shakespeare is a rendering of Sonnet CXXX in popularized
Eastern, as distinguished from Aasen's literary, aristocratic Western
Landsmaal. It is the first translation of a Shakespearean sonnet
on Norwegian soil. The new language was hewing out new paths.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">18</span>
Obviously this is not a sonnet at all. Not only does the translator
ignore Shakespeare's rime scheme, but he sets aside the elementary
definition of a sonnet&mdash;a poem of fourteen lines. We have
here sixteen lines and the last two add nothing to the original.
The poet, through lack of skill, has simply run on. He could have
ended with line 14 and then, whatever other criticism might have
been passed upon his work, we should have had at least the sonnet
form. The additional lines are in themselves fairly good poetry
but they have no place in what purports to be translation. The
translator signs himself simply "r." Whoever he was, he had poetic
feeling and power of expression. No mere poetaster could have
given lines so exquisite in their imagery, so full of music, and so
happy in their phrasing. This fact in itself makes it a poor translation,
for it is rather a paraphrase with a quality and excellence
all its own. Not a line exactly renders the English. The paraphrase
is never so good as the original but, considered by itself,
it is good poetry. The disillusionment comes only with comparison.
On the whole, this second attempt to put Shakespeare
into Landsmaal was distinctly less successful than the first. As
poetry it does not measure up to Aasen; as translation it is
periphrastic, arbitrary, not at all faithful.</p>


<h2>F</h2>

<p>The translations which we have thus far considered were mere
fragments&mdash;brief soliloquies or a single sonnet, and they were
done into a dialect which was not then and is not now the prevailing
literary language of the country. They were earnest and,
in the case of Aasen, successful attempts to show that Landsmaal
was adequate to the most varied and remote of styles. But many
years were to elapse before anyone attempted the far more difficult
task of turning any considerable part of Shakespeare into
"Modern Norwegian."</p>

<p>Norway still relied, with no apparent sense of humiliation,
on the translations of Shakespeare as they came up from Copenhagen.
In 1881, however, Hartvig Lassen (1824-1897) translated
<i>The Merchant of Venice</i>.<a name = "tag1_19"
href = "#note1_19"><sup>I.19</sup></a>
Lassen matriculated as a student in
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
1842, and from 1850 supported himself as a literateur, writing
reviews of books and plays for <i>Krydseren</i> and
<i>Aftenposten</i>. In
1872 he was appointed Artistic Censor at the theater, and in that
office translated a multitude of plays from almost every language
of Western Europe. His published translations of Shakespeare
are, however, quite unrelated to his theatrical work. They were
done for school use and published by <i>Selskabet for Folkeoplysningens
Fremme</i> (Society for the Promotion of Popular Education).</p>

<p>To <i>Kjøbmanden i Venedig</i> there is no introduction and no
notes&mdash;merely a postscript in which the translator declares that
he has endeavored everywhere faithfully to reproduce the peculiar
tone of the play and to preserve the concentration of style
which is everywhere characteristic of Shakespeare. He acknowledges
his indebtedness to the Swedish translation by Hagberg
and the German by Schlegel. Inasmuch as this work was published
for wide, general distribution and for reading in the schools,
Lassen cut out the passages which he deemed unsuitable for the
untutored mind. "But," he adds, "with the exception of the
last scene of Act III, which, in its expurgated form, would be too
fragmentary (and which, indeed, does not bear any immediate
relation to the action), only a few isolated passages have been cut.
Shakespeare has lost next to nothing, and a great deal has been
gained if I have hereby removed one ground for the hesitation
which most teachers would feel in using the book in the public
schools." In Act III, Scene 5 is omitted entirely, and obvious
passages in other parts of the play.</p>

<p>It has frequently been said that Lassen did little more than
"norvagicize" Lembcke's Danish renderings. And certainly
even the most cursory reading will show that he had Lembcke at
hand. But comparison will also show that variations from Lembcke
are numerous and considerable. Lassen was a man of letters,
a critic, and a good student of foreign languages, but he was no
poet, and his <i>Merchant of Venice</i> is, generally speaking, much
inferior to Lembcke's. Compare, for example, the exquisite
opening of the fifth act:</p>

<p>Lembcke's version is faithful to the point of slavishness.
Compare, for example, "Jeg skulde sagtens overnatte dig" with
"I would outnight you." Lassen, though never grossly inaccurate,
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
allows himself greater liberties. Compare lines 2-6 with
the original and with Lembcke. In every case the Danish version
is more faithful than the Norwegian. And more mellifluous.
Why Lassen should choose such clumsy and banal lines as:</p>

<div class = "verse4">
I slig en Nat</div>
<div class = "verse">
Trojas Murtinder Troilus besteg
</div>

<p>when he could have used Lembcke's, is inexplicable except on
the hypothesis that he was eager to prove his own originality.
The remainder of Lorenzo's first speech is scarcely better. It is
neither good translation nor decent verse.</p>

<p>In 1882 came Lassen's <i>Julius Caesar</i>,<a name = "tag1_20"
href = "#note1_20"><sup>I.20</sup></a> likewise published as
a supplement to <i>Folkevennen</i> for use in the schools. A short
postscript tells us that the principles which governed in the translation
of the earlier play have governed here also. Lassen specifically
declares that he used Foersom's translation (Copenhagen,
1811) as the basis for the translation of Antony's oration. A comparison
shows that in this scene Lassen follows Foersom closely&mdash;he
keeps archaisms which Lembcke amended. One or two instances:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><i>Foersom</i>:</td>
<td>

</tr>
</table>

<p>For the rest, a reading of this translation leaves the same impression
as a reading of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>&mdash;it is a reasonably
good piece of work but distinctly inferior to Foersom and to
Lembcke's modernization of Foersom. Lassen clearly had
Lembcke at hand; he seldom, however, followed him for more
than a line or two. What is more important is that there are
reminiscences of Foersom not only in the funeral scene, where
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
Lassen himself acknowledges the fact, but elsewhere. Note a
few lines from the quarrel between Brutus and Cassius (Act IV,
Sc. 3) beginning with Cassius' speech:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself.
</div>

<p>Foersom (Ed. 1811) has:</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>italicized</i> passages show that the influence of Foersom
was felt in more than one scene. It would be easy to give other
instances.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">23</span>
After all this, we need scarcely more than mention Lassen's
<i>Macbeth</i><a name = "tag1_21" href = "#note1_21"><sup>I.21</sup></a>
published in 1883. The usual brief note at the end of
the play gives the usual information that, out of regard for the
purpose for which the translation has been made, certain parts
of the porter scene and certain speeches by Malcolm in Act IV,
Sc. 3 have been cut. Readers will have no difficulty in picking
them out.</p>

<p><i>Macbeth</i> is, like all Lassen's work, dull and prosaic. Like
his other translations from Shakespeare, it has never become
popular. The standard translation in Norway is still the
Foersom-Lembcke, a trifle nationalized with Norwegian words and
phrases whenever a new acting version is to be prepared. And
while it is not true that Lassen's translations are merely norvagicized
editions of the Danish, it is true that they are often so
little independent of them that they do not deserve to supersede
the work of Foersom and Lembcke.</p>


<h2>G</h2>

<p>Norwegian translations of Shakespeare cannot, thus far, be
called distinguished. There is no complete edition either in
Riksmaal or Landsmaal. A few sonnets, a play or two, a scrap
of dialogue&mdash;Norway has little Shakespeare translation of her
own. Qualitatively, the case is somewhat better. Several
of the renderings we have considered are extremely creditable,
though none of them can be compared with the best in
Danish or Swedish. It is a grateful task, therefore, to call attention
to the translations by Christen Collin. They are not numerous&mdash;only
eleven short fragments published as illustrative
material in his school edition (English text) of <i>The Merchant of
Venice</i><a name = "tag1_22"
href = "#note1_22"><sup>I.22</sup></a>&mdash;but
they are of notable quality, and they save the Riksmaal
literature from the reproach of surrendering completely to the
Landsmaal the task of turning Shakespeare into Norwegian.
With the exception of a few lines from <i>Macbeth</i> and <i>Othello</i>,
the
selections are all from <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">24</span>
A good part of Collin's success must be attributed to his
intimate familiarity with English. The fine nuances of the language
do not escape him, and he can use it not with precision
merely but with audacity and power. Long years of close and
sympathetic association with the literature of England has made
English well-nigh a second mother tongue to this fine and appreciative
critic. But he is more than a critic. He has more than
a little of the true poet's insight and the true poet's gift of song.
All this has combined to give us a body of translations which, for
fine felicity, stand unrivalled in Dano-Norwegian. Many of
these have been prepared for lecture purposes and have never
been printed.<a name = "tag1_23"
href = "#note1_23"><sup>I.23</sup></a> Only a
few have been perpetuated in this text
edition of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>. We shall discuss the edition
itself below. Our concern here is with the translations. We
remember Lassen's and Lembcke's opening of the fifth act. Collin
is more successful than his countryman.</p>

<p>"A translation of this passage," says Collin,<a name = "tag1_24"

more than a feeble approximation. It is not equal to Shakespeare,

<h2>H</h2>

<p>We have hitherto discussed the Norwegian translations of
Shakespeare in almost exact chronological order. It has been
possible to do this because the plays have either been translated
by a single man and issued close together, as in the case of Hartvig
Lassen, or they have appeared separately from the hands of different
translators and at widely different periods. We come now,
however, to a group of translations which, although the work of
different men and published independently from 1901 to 1912,
nevertheless belong together. They are all in Landsmaal and
they represent quite clearly an effort to enrich the literature of
the new dialect with translations from Shakespeare. To do this
successfully would, obviously, be a great gain. The Maalstrævere
would thereby prove the capacity of their tongue for the highest,
most exotic forms of literature. They would give to it, moreover,
the discipline which the translation of foreign classics could
not fail to afford. It was thus a renewal of the missionary spirit
of Ivar Aasen. And behind it all was the defiant feeling that
Norwegians should have Shakespeare in Norwegian, not in Danish
or bastard Danish.</p>

<p>The spirit of these translations is obvious enough from the
opening sentence of Madhus' preface to his translation of
<i>Macbeth</i>:<a name = "tag1_27"
href = "#note1_27"><sup>I.27</sup></a>
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
"I should hardly have ventured to publish this first attempt at
a Norwegian translation of Shakespeare if competent men had
not urged me to do so." It is frankly declared to be the first
Norwegian translation of Shakespeare. Hauge and Lassen, to
say nothing of the translator of 1818, are curtly dismissed from
Norwegian literature. They belong to Denmark. This might be
true if it were not for the bland assumption that nothing is really
Norwegian except what is written in the dialect of a particular
group of Norwegians. The fundamental error of the "Maalstrævere"
is the inability to comprehend the simple fact that language
has no natural, instinctive connection with race. An
American born in America of Norwegian parents <i>may</i>, if his
parents are energetic and circumstances favorable, learn the
tongue of his father and mother, but his natural speech, the medium
he uses easily, his real mother-tongue, will be English. Will it
be contended that this American has lost anything in spiritual
power or linguistic facility? Quite the contrary. The use of
Danish in Norway has had the unfortunate effect of stirring
up a bitter war between the two literary languages or the two
dialects of the same language, but it has imposed no bonds on the
literary or intellectual powers of a large part of the people, for
the simple reason that these people have long used the language
as their own. And because they live in Norway they have made
the speech Norwegian. Despite its Danish origin, Dano-Norwegian
is today as truly Norwegian as any other Norwegian
dialect, and in its literary form it is, in a sense, more Norwegian
than the literary Landsmaal, for the language of Bjørnson has
grown up gradually on Norwegian soil; the language of Ivar
Aasen is not yet acclimatized.</p>

<p>For these reasons it will not do to let Madhus' calm assertion
go unchallenged. The fact is that to a large part of the Norwegian
people Lassen's translations represent merely a slightly Danicized
form of their own language, while to the same people the
language of Madhus is at least as foreign as Swedish. This is
not the place for a discussion of "Sprogstriden." We may give
full recognition to Landsmaal without subscribing to the creed of
enthusiasts. And it is still easier to give credit to the excellence
of the Shakespeare translations in Landsmaal without concerning
ourselves with the partisanship of the translator. What shall
we say, then, of the <i>Macbeth</i> of Olav Madhus?</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">28</span>
First, that it is decidedly good. The tragedy of Macbeth is
stark, grim, stern, and the vigorous, resonant Norwegian fits
admirably. There is little opportunity, as in Aasen's selections
from <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> for those unfortunate contrasts between
the homespun of the modern dialect and the exquisite silk and
gossamer of the vocabulary of romance of a "cultured language."
Madhus has been successful in rendering into Landsmaal scenes
as different as the witch-scene, the porter-scene (which Lassen
omitted for fear it would contaminate the minds of school children),
the exquisite lines of the King and Banquo on their arrival at
Macbeth's castle, and Macbeth's last, tragic soliloquy when he
learns of the death of his queen.</p>

<p>Duncan and Banquo arrive at the castle of Macbeth and Duncan
speaks those lovely lines: "This castle has a pleasant seat,"
etc. Madhus translates:</p>

<div class = "speaker">Duncan:</div>

<p>The deep tones of a language born in mountains and along

<p>This is not only accurate; it is a decidedly successful imitation
of the movement of the original. Madhus has done a first-rate
piece of work. The language of witch-craft is as international
as the language of science. But only a poet can turn it to poetic
use.</p>

<p>Not quite so successful is Macbeth's soliloquy when the death
of Lady Macbeth is announced to him:</p>

<div class = "verse4">
Det skuld'ho drygt med.</div>
<div class = "verse">
Aat slikt eit ord var komi betre stund.&mdash;<br>

til siste ord i livsens sogubok;<br>
og kvart "i gaar" hev daarer vegen lyst<br>
til dust og daude.
</div>

<p>It is difficult to say just where the fault lies, but the thing
seems uncouth, a trifle too colloquial and peasant-like. The
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
fault may be the translator's, but something must also be charged
to his medium. The passage in Shakespeare is simple but it
breathes distinction. The Landsmaal version is merely colloquial,
even banal. One fine line there is:</p>

<div class = "verse">
"til siste ord i livsens sogubok."
</div>

<p>But the rest suggests too plainly the limitations of an uncultivated
speech.</p>

<p>In 1905 came a translation of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>
by Madhus,<a name = "tag1_28" href = "#note1_28"><sup>I.28</sup></a>
and, uniform with it, a little book&mdash;<i>Soga um Kaupmannen i
Venetia</i> (The Story of The Merchant of Venice) in which the action
of the play is told in simple prose. In the appendatory notes the
translator acknowledges his obligation to Arne Garborg&mdash;"Arne
Garborg hev gjort mig framifraa god hjelp, her som med <i>Macbeth</i>.
Takk og ære hev han."</p>

<p>What we have said of <i>Macbeth</i> applies with no less force here.
The translation is more than merely creditable&mdash;it is distinctly
good. And certainly it is no small feat to have translated Shakespeare
in all his richness and fulness into what was only fifty years
ago a rustic and untrained dialect. It is the best answer possible
to the charge often made against Landsmaal that it is utterly
unable to convey the subtle thought of high and cosmopolitan
culture. This was the indictment of Bjørnson,<a name = "tag1_29"
href = "#note1_29"><sup>I.29</sup></a> of philologists
like Torp,<a name = "tag1_30" href = "#note1_30"><sup>I.30</sup></a>
and of a literary critic like Hjalmar Christensen.<a name = "tag1_31"
href = "#note1_31"><sup>I.31</sup></a>
The last named speaks repeatedly of the feebleness of Landsmaal
when it swerves from its task of depicting peasant life. His criticism
of the poetry of Ivar Mortensen is one long variation of this
theme&mdash;the immaturity of Landsmaal. All of this is true. A
finished literary language, even when its roots go deep into a
spoken language, cannot be created in a day. It must be enriched
and elaborated, and it must gain flexibility from constant
and varied use. It is precisely this apprentice stage that Landsmaal
is now in. The finished "Kultursprache" will come in
good time. No one who has read Garborg will deny that it can
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
convey the subtlest emotions; and Madhus' translations of Shakespeare
are further evidence of its possibilities.</p>

<p>That Madhus does not measure up to his original will astonish
no one who knows Shakespeare translations in other languages.
Even Tieck's and Schlegel's German, or Hagberg's Swedish, or
Foersom's Danish is no substitute for Shakespeare. Whether or
not Madhus measures up to these is not for me to decide, but I
feel very certain that he will not suffer by comparison with the
Danish versions by Wolff, Meisling, Wosemose, or even Lembcke,
or with the Norwegian versions of Hauge and Lassen. The feeling that
one gets in reading Madhus is not that he is uncouth, still less
inaccurate, but that in the presence of great imaginative richness
he becomes cold and barren. We felt it less in the tragedy of
<i>Macbeth</i>, where romantic color is absent; we feel it strongly in
<i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, where the richness of romance is instinct
in every line. The opening of the play offers a perfect illustration.
In answer to Antonio's complaint "In sooth I know not why I am so sad,"
etc, Salarino replies in these stately and sounding lines:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Your mind is tossing on the ocean;<br>
There, where your argosies, with portly sail,&mdash;<br>
Like signiors and rich burghers of the flood,<br>
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,&mdash;<br>
Do overpeer the petty traffickers<br>
That curt'sy to them, do them reverence,<br>
As they fly by them with their woven wings.
</div>

<p>The picture becomes very much less stately in Norwegian
folk-speech:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Paa storehave huskar hugen din,<br>
der dine langferd-skip med staute segl<br>
som hovdingar og herremenn paa sjø<br>

som nigjer aat deim og som helsar audmjukt<br>
naar dei med vovne vengir framum stryk.
</div>

<p>The last two lines are adequate, but the rest has too much
the flavor of Ole and Peer discussing the fate of their fishing-smacks.
Somewhat more successful is the translation of the opening
of Act V, doubtless because it is simpler, less full of remote and
sophisticated imagery. By way of comparison with Lassen and
Collin, it may be interesting to have it at hand.</p>

<p>But when Madhus turns from such flights of high poetry to
low comedy, his success is complete. It may be a long time
before Landsmaal can successfully render the mighty line of
Marlowe, or the manifold music of Shakespeare, but we should
expect it to give with perfect verity the language of the people.
And when we read the scenes in which <ins class = "correction"
title = "spelling as in original">Lancelot</ins> Gobbo figures,
there is no doubt that here Landsmaal is at home. Note, for
example, Act II, Sc. 1:</p>

<div class = "speech">
"Samvite mitt vil visst ikkje hjelpe meg med aa røme fraa denne juden,
husbond min. Fenden stend her attum òlbogen min og segjer til meg:
"Gobbo, Lanselot Gobbo; gode Lanselot, eller gode Gobbo, bruka leggine;
tak hyven; drag din veg." Samvite segjer: "nei, agta deg, ærlige Gobbo,"
eller som fyr sagt: "ærlige Lanselot Gobbo, røm ikkje; set deg mot røming
med hæl og taa!" Men fenden, den stormodige, bed meg pakka meg; "fremad
mars!" segjer
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
fenden; "legg i veg!" segjer fenden; "for alt som heilagt er," segjer
fenden; "vaaga paa; drag i veg!" Men samvite heng un halsen paa hjarta
mitt og talar visdom til meg; "min ærlige ven Lanselot, som er son av ein
ærlig mann, eller rettare: av eit ærligt kvende; for skal eg segja sant,
so teva det eit grand svidt av far min; han hadde som ein <ins class =
"correction" title = "original reads 'altaat-snev'">attaat-snev</ins>;
naah; samvite segjer: "du skal ikkje fantegaa." "Du skal fantegaa,"
segjer fenden; "nei; ikkje fantegaa," segjer samvite. "Du samvit," segjer
eg, "du raader meg godt." "Du <ins class = "correction" title =
"close quote missing in original">fenden," segjer eg</ins>, "du raader
meg godt." Fylgde eg no samvite, so vart eg verande hjaa juden,
som&mdash;forlate mi synd&mdash;er noko som ein devel; og rømer eg fraa
juden, so lyder eg fenden, som&mdash;beintfram sagt&mdash;er develen

mitt vit er samvite mit vitlaust, som vil raade meg til aa verta verande
hjaa juden. Fenden gjev meg den venlegaste raadi; eg tek kuten, fenden;
hælane mine stend til din kommando; eg tek kuten."
</div>

<p>This has the genuine ring. The brisk colloquial vocabulary
fits admirably the brilliant sophistry of the argument. And both
could come only from Launcelot Gobbo. For "the simplicity
of the folk" is one of those fictions which romantic closet study
has woven around the study of "the people."</p>

<p>Of the little re-telling of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, "Soga um
Kaupmannen i Venetia"<a name = "tag1_32"
href = "#note1_32"><sup>I.32</sup></a>
which appeared in the same year, nothing
need be said. It is a simple, unpretentious summary of the story
with a certain charm which simplicity and naïveté always give.
No name appears on the title-page, but we are probably safe in
attributing it to Madhus, for in the note to <i>Kaupmannen i Venetia</i>
we read: <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'I, Soga'">"I&nbsp;<i>Soga</i></ins>
<i>um Kaupmannen i Venetia</i> hev ein sjølve
forteljingi som stykkji er bygt paa."</p>


<h2>I</h2>

<p>In the year 1903, midway between the publication of Madhus'
<i>Macbeth</i> and the appearance of his <i>Kaupmannen i Venetia</i>,
there appeared in the chief literary magazine of the Landsmaal movement,
"Syn og Segn," a translation of the fairy scenes of <i>A&nbsp;Midsummer
Night's Dream</i> by Erik Eggen.<a name = "tag1_33"
href = "#note1_33"><sup>I.33</sup></a>
This is the sort of material
which we should expect Landsmaal to render well. Oberon and
Titania are not greatly different from Nissen and Alverne in
Norwegian fairy tales, and the translator had but to fancy himself
in Alveland to be in the enchanted wood near Athens. The
spirit of the fairy scenes in Shakespeare is akin to the spirit of
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
Asbjørnson's "Huldre-Eventyr." There is in them a community
of feeling, of fancy, of ideas. And whereas Madhus had difficulty
with the sunny romance of Italy, Eggen in the story of Puck
found material ready to hand. The passage translated begins Act
II, Sc. 1, and runs through Act II to Oberon's words immediately
before the entrance of Helen and Demetrius:</p>

<div class = "verse">
But who comes here? I am invisible;<br>
And I will overhear their conference.
</div>

<p>Then the translator omits everything until Puck re-enters and Oberon
greets him with the words:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'Velkomon'">Velkomen</ins>, vandrar; hev du
blomen der?<br>
(Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.)
</div>

<p>Here the translation begins again and goes to the exit of Oberon
and the entrance of Lysander and Hermia. This is all in the
first selection in <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'Syn og segn'"><i>Syn og Segn</i></ins>,
No. 3.</p>

<p>In the sixth number of the same year (1903) the work is continued. The
translation here begins with Puck's words (Act III):</p>

<div class = "verse">
What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here?<br>
So near the cradle of the fairy queen?<br>
What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;<br>
An actor, too, if I see cause.
</div>

<p>Then it breaks off again and resumes with the entrance of Puck
and Bottom adorned with an ass's head. Quince's words: "O
monstrous! O strange!" are given and then Puck's speech: "I'll
follow you: I'll lead you about a round." After this there is a
break till Bottom's song:</p>

<div class = "verse">
"The ousel cock, so black of hue," etc.
</div>

<p>And now all proceeds without break to the <i>Hail</i> of the last elf
called in to serve Bottom, but the following speeches between
Bottom and the fairies, Cobweb, Mustardseed and Peaseblossom,
are all cut, and the scene ends with Titania's speech:</p>

<div class = "verse">
"Come, wait upon him, lead him to my bower," etc.
</div>

<p>Act III, Sc. 2, follows immediately, but the translation ends with the
first line of Oberon's speech to Puck before the entrance of Demetrius
and Hermia:</p>

<div class = "verse">
"This falls out better than I could devise."
</div>

<p>and resumes with Oberon's words:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<div class = "verse">
"I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy,"
</div>

<p>and includes (with the omission of the last two lines) Oberon's speech
beginning:</p>

<div class = "verse">
"But we are spirits of another sort."
</div>

<p>Eggen then jumps to the fourth act and translates Titania's
opening speech. After this there is a break till the entrance of
Oberon. The dialogue between Titania and Oberon is given
faithfully, except that in the speech in which Oberon removes the
incantation, all the lines referring to the wedding of Theseus are
omitted; the speeches of Puck, Oberon, and Titania immediately
preceding the entrance of Theseus, Hippolyta, Egeus, and their
train, are rendered.</p>

<p>From Act V the entire second scene is given.</p>

<p>Eggen has, then, attempted to give a translation into Norwegian
Landsmaal of the fairy scenes in <i>A&nbsp;Midsummer Night's
Dream</i>. He has confined himself severely to his task as thus
limited, even cutting out lines from the middle of speeches when
these lines refer to another part of the action or to another group
of characters. What we have is, then, a fragment, to be defended
only as an experiment, and successful in proportion as it renders
single lines, speeches, or songs well. On the whole, Eggen has
been successful. There is a vigor and directness in his style
which, indeed, seem rather Norwegian than Shakespearean, but
which are, nevertheless, entirely convincing. One is scarcely
conscious that it is a translation. And in the lighter, more romantic
passages Eggen has hit the right tone with entire fidelity. His
knowledge is sound. His notes, though exhibiting no special
learning, show clearly that he is abreast of modern scholarship.
Whenever his rendering seems daring, he accompanies it with
a note that clearly and briefly sets forth why a particular word
or phrase was chosen. The standard Danish, Norwegian, and
German translations are known to him, and occasionally he borrows
from them. But he knows exactly why he does borrow. His
scholarship and his real poetic power combine to give us a translation
of which Landsmaal literature has every reason to be proud.
We need give only a few passages. I like the rollicking humor of
Puck's words:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Kor torer uhengt kjeltrings pakk daa skvaldre<br>
so nære vogga hennar alvemor?<br>
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
Kva?&mdash;skodespel i gjerdom? Eg vil sjaa paa&mdash;<br>
kann hende spele med, um so eg synest.
</div>

<p>And a little farther on when Bottom, adorned with his ass's head,
returns with Puck, and the simple players flee in terror and Puck
exclaims:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Eg fylgjer dykk og fører rundt i tunn,<br>
i myr og busk og ormegras og klunger,<br>
og snart eg er ein hest og snart ein hund,<br>
ein gris, ein mannvond bjørn, snart flammetungur,<br>
og kneggjer, gøyr og ryler, murrar, brenn,<br>
som hest, hund, gris, bjørn, varme&mdash;eitt um senn.
</div>

<p>we give our unqualified admiration to the skill of the translator. Or,
compare Titania's instructions to the <ins class = "correction" title =
"original reads 'faries'">fairies</ins> to serve her Bottom:</p>

<div class = "verse">

</div>

<p>It is, however, in his exquisitely delicate rendering of the
songs of this play&mdash;certainly one of the most difficult tasks that
a
translator can undertake&mdash;that Eggen has done his best work.
There is more than a distant echo of the original in this happy
translation of Bottom's song:</p>

<div class = "verse">

<p>It is easy to draw upon this fragment for further examples of
felicitous translation. It is scarcely necessary, however. What
has been given is sufficient to show the rare skill of the translator.
He is so fortunate as to possess in a high degree what Bayard
Taylor calls "secondary inspiration," without which the work of
a translator becomes a soulless mass and frequently degenerates
into the veriest drivel. Erik Eggen's <i>Alveliv</i> deserves a place in
the same high company with Taylor's <i>Faust</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">38</span>
Nine years later, in 1912, Eggen returned to the task he had
left unfinished with the fairy scenes in <i>Syn og Segn</i> and gave a
complete translation of <i>A&nbsp;Midsummer Night's Dream</i>. In a little
prefatory note he acknowledges his indebtedness to Arne Garborg,
who critically examined the manuscript and gave valuable suggestions
and advice. The introduction itself is a restatement in
two pages of the Shakespeare-Essex-Leicester-Elizabeth story.
Shakespeare recalls the festivities as he saw them in youth when
he writes in Act II, Sc. 2:</p>

<div class = "verse3">
thou rememberest</div>
<div class = "verse">
Since once I sat upon a promontory,<br>
And heard a mermaid upon a dolphin's back, etc.
</div>

<p>And it is Elizabeth he has in mind when, in the same scene,
we read:</p>

<div class = "verse">
That very time I saw, but thou could'st not,<br>
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,<br>
Cupid all armed, etc.
</div>

<p>All of this is given by way of background, and it is of little
importance to the general readers what modern Shakespeare scholars
may say of it.</p>

<p>Eggen has not been content merely to reprint in the complete
translation his earlier work from <i>Syn og Segn</i>, but he has made
a thoroughgoing revision.<a name = "tag1_36"
href = "#note1_36"><sup>I.36</sup></a>
It cannot be said to be altogether
happy. Frequently, of course, a line or phrase is improved or an
awkward turn straightened out, but, as a whole, the first version
surpasses the second not in poetic beauty merely, but in accuracy.
Compare, for example, the two renderings of the opening lines:</p>

Now, admitting that

<div class = "verse2">
eg dogge maa<br>
dei grøne straa</div>
<div class = "verse">
som vaar dronning dansar paa.
</div>

<p>is a better translation than in the <i>Syn og Segn</i>
text&mdash;which is doubtful enough&mdash;it is difficult to see what can
be the excuse for such pompous banality as</p>

<div class = "verse2">
Kvart nykelband<br>
er adelsmann,</div>
<div class = "verse">
med ordenar dei glime kann;
</div>

<p>the first version is not above reproach in this respect. It might
fairly be asked: where does Eggen get his authority for</p>

<div class = "verse">
sjaa dei stjernur alvar gav deim!
</div>

<p>But the lines are not loaded down with imagery which is both
misleading and in bad taste. Eggen should have left his first
version unchanged. Such uninspired prose as:</p>

<div class = "verse2">
kvar blank rubin,<br>
paa bringa skin,</div>
<div class = "verse">
utsender ange fin.
</div>

<p>have to the ears of most Norwegians the atmosphere of the back stairs.
Better the unadorned version of 1903.</p>

<p>In the passage following, Robin's reply, the revised version
is probably better than the first, <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'thought here'">though there</ins> seems to be
little to choose between them. But in the fairy's next speech the
translator has gone quite beyond his legitimate province, and has
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
improved Shakespeare by a picture from Norwegian folklore. Following the
lines of the original:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Misleade nightwanderers, laughing at their harm,
</div>

<p>Eggen has added this homelike conception in his translation:</p>

<div class = "verse">
som òg kann draga fôr til hest og naut,<br>
naar berre du kvar torsdag fær din graut.
</div>

<p>Shakespeare in Elysium must have regretted that he was not born
in the mountains of Norway!</p>

<p>And when Robin, in the speech that follows, tells of his antics,
one wonders just a little what has been gained by the revision.
The same query is constantly suggested to anyone who compares
the two texts.</p>

<p>Nor do I think that the lyrics have gained by the revision.
Just a single comparison&mdash;the lullaby in the two versions. We
have given it above as published in <i>Syn og Segn</i>. The following
is its revised form:</p>

<div class = "speaker">Fyrste alven:</div>
<div class = "verse">
Spettut orm, bustyvel kvass,<br>
eiter-ødle, sleve graa,<br>
fare burt fraa denne plass,<br>
so vaar dronning sova maa!
</div>
<div class = "speaker">Alle:</div>
<div class = "verse">

<div class = "verse2">

<div class = "verse3">
Troll og nykk,</div>
<div class = "verse2">

<div class = "verse">

So god natt! Sov søtt i lund!
</div>
<div class = "speaker">Andre alven:</div>
<div class = "verse">

langt ifraa oss din spune spinn!
</div>
<div class = "speaker">Alle:</div>
<div class = "verse">
Maaltrost, syng med oss i lund, etc.
</div>

<p>The first version is not only more literal but, so far as I can
judge, superior in every way&mdash;in music and delicacy of phrase.
And again, Eggen has taken it upon himself to patch up Shakespeare
with homespun rags from his native Norwegian parish.
It is difficult to say upon what grounds such tinkerings with the
text as:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<div class = "verse">
Byssam, byssam barne,<br>
gryta, heng i jarne,
</div>

<p>can be defended.</p>

<p>But we have already devoted too much space to this matter.
Save for a few isolated lines, Eggen might very well have left
these scenes as he gave them to us in 1903. We then ask, "What
of the much greater part of the play now translated for the first
time?" Well, no one will dispute the translator's triumph in
this scene:<a name = "tag1_37" href = "#note1_37"><sup>I.37</sup></a></p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">42</span>
There can be no doubt about the genuineness of this. It
catches the spirit of the original and communicates it irresistibly
to the reader. When Bottom (Varp) says "Kva er Pyramus for
slags kar?" or when he threatens, "Eg skal grøte steinen, eg skal
jamre so fælt so," one who has something of Norwegian "Sprachgefühl"
will exclaim that this is exactly what it should be. It is
not the language of Norwegian artisans&mdash;they do not speak Landsmaal.
But neither is the language of Shakespeare's craftsmen
the genuine spoken language of Elizabethan craftsmen. The
important thing is that the tone is right. And this feeling of a
right tone is still further satisfied in the rehearsal scene (III, Sc.
1).
Certain slight liberties do not diminish our pleasure. The reminiscence
of <i>Richard III</i> in Bottom's, "A calendar, a calendar,
looke in the Almanack, finde out moonshine," translated "Ei
almanakke, ei almanakke, mit kongerike for ei almanakke,"
seems, however, a labored piece of business. One line, too, has
been added to this speech which is a gratuitous invention of the
translator, or rather, taken from the curious malaprop speech of
the laboring classes; "Det er rett, Per Mønsaas; sjaa millom
aspektarane!" There can be no objection to an interpolation
like this if the translation does not aim to be scholarly and definitive,
but merely an effort to bring a foreign classic home to the masses.
And this is, obviously, Eggen's purpose. Personally I do
not think, therefore, that there is any objection to a slight freedom
like this. But it has no place at all in the fairies' lullaby.</p>

<p>When we move to the circle of the high-place lovers or the
court, I cannot feel that the Landsmaal is quite so convincing.
There is something appallingly clumsy, labored, hard, in this speech
of Hermia's:</p>

<div class = "verse4">
Min eigin gut,</div>
<div class = "verse">
eg sver ved beste bogen Amor hev,<br>
ved beste pili hans, med odd av gull,<br>
ved duvune, dei reine og dei kvite<br>
som flyg paa tun hjaa fagre Afrodite,<br>
ved det som knyter mannehjarto saman,<br>
ved det som føder kjærlerks fryd og gaman,<br>
ved baale, der seg dronning Dido brende,<br>
daa seg Æneas trulaus fraa ho vende,<br>
ved kvar den eid som falske menn hev svori&mdash;<br>
langt <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'fler'">fleir</ins> enn kvinnelippur
fram hev bori,<br>
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
at paa den staden du hev nemnt for meg,<br>
der skal i morgo natt eg møte deg.
</div>

<p>In spite of the translator's obvious effort to put fire into the
passage, his failure is all too evident. Even the ornament of
these lines&mdash;to which there is nothing to
correspond in the original&mdash;only
makes the poetry more forcibly feeble:</p>

<div class = "verse">
ved duvune, dei reine og dei kvite<br>
som flyg paa tun hjaa fagre Afrodite,
</div>

<p>Shakespeare says quite simply:</p>

<div class = "verse">
By the simplicity of Venus Doves,
</div>

<p>and to anyone but a Landsmaal fanatic it seems ridiculous to
have Theseus tell Hermia: "Demetrius er so gild ein kar som
nokon." "Demetrius is a worthy gentleman," says Shakespeare
and this has "the grand Manner." But to a cultivated
Norwegian the translation is "Bauernsprache," such as a local
magnate might use in forcing a suitor on his daughter.</p>

<p>All of which goes back to the present condition of Landsmaal.
It has little flexibility, little inward grace. It is not a finished
literary language. But, despite its archaisms, Landsmaal is a
living language and it has, therefore, unlike the Karathevusa
of Greece, the possibility of growth. The translations of Madhus
and Aasen and Eggen have made notable contributions to this
development. They are worthy of all praise. Their weaknesses
are the result of conditions which time will change.</p>


<h2>J</h2>

<p>One might be tempted to believe from the foregoing that the
propagandists of "Maalet" had completely monopolized the
noble task of making Shakespeare accessible in the vernacular.
And this is almost true. But the reason is not far to seek. Aside
from the fact that in Norway, as elsewhere, Shakespeare is read
mainly by cultivated people, among whom a sound reading knowledge
of English is general, we have further to remember that the
<ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'Forsom'">Foersom</ins>-Lembcke
version has become standard in Norway and
no real need has been felt of a separate Norwegian version in
the dominant literary language. In Landsmaal the case is different.
This dialect must be trained to "Literaturfähigkeit."
It is not so much that Norway must have her own Shakespeare
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
as that Landsmaal must be put to use in every type of literature.
The results of this missionary spirit we have seen.</p>

<p>One of the few translations of Shakespeare that have been made
into Riksmaal appeared in 1912, <i>Hamlet</i>, by C.H. Blom. As an
experiment it is worthy of respect, but as a piece of literature it is
not to be taken seriously. Like Lassen's work, it is honest,
faithful, and utterly uninspired.</p>

<p>The opening scene of <i>Hamlet</i> is no mean test of a translator's
ability&mdash;this quick, tense scene, one of the finest in dramatic
literature. Foersom did it with conspicuous success. Blom has
reduced it to the following prosy stuff:</p>

<div class = "speaker">

</div>

<p>It requires little knowledge of Norwegian to dismiss this as
dull and insipid prose, a part of which has accidentally been
turned into mechanical blank verse. Moreover, the work is
marked throughout by inconsistency and carelessness in details.
For instance the king begins (p. 7) by addressing Laertes:</p>

<div class = "speech">
Hvad melder <i>De</i> mig on <i>Dem</i> selv, Laertes?
</div>

<p>and two lines below:</p>

<div class = "speech">
Hvad kan <i>du</i> be mig om?
</div>

<p><span class = "pagenum">45</span>
It might be a mere slip that the translator in one line uses the
formal <i>De</i> and in another the familiar <i>du</i>,
but the same inconsistency
occurs again and again throughout the volume. In itself
a trifle, it indicates clearly enough the careless, slipshod manner
of work&mdash;and an utter lack of a sense of humor, for no one with
a spark of humor would use the modern, essentially German <i>De</i>
in a Norwegian translation of Shakespeare. If a formal form
must be used it should, as a matter of course, be <i>I</i>.</p>

<p>Nor is the translation itself so accurate as it should be. For
example, what does it mean when Marcellus tells Bernardo that
he had implored Horatio "at vogte paa minutterne inat" (to
watch over the minutes this night)? Again, in the King's speech
to Hamlet (Act I, Sc. 2) the phrase "bend you to remain" is
rendered by the categorical "se til at bli herhjemme," which is
at least misleading. Little inaccuracies of this sort are not
infrequent.</p>

<p>But, after all, a translator with a new variorum and a wealth
of critical material at hand cannot go far wrong in point of mere
translation. The chief indictment to be made against Blom's
translation is its prosiness, its prosy, involved sentences, its
banality. What in Shakespeare is easy and mellifluous often becomes
in Blom so vague that its meaning has to be discovered by a reference
to the original.</p>

<p>We gave, some pages back, Ivar Aasen's translation of Hamlet's
soliloquy. The interesting thing about that translation is not
only that it is the first one in Norwegian but that it was made
into a new dialect by the creator of that dialect himself. When
we look back and consider what Aasen had to do&mdash;first, make a
literary medium, and then pour into the still rigid and inelastic
forms of that language the subtlest thinking of a great world
literature&mdash;we gain a new respect for his genius. Fifty years later
Blom tried his hand at the same soliloquy. He was working in
an old and tried literary medium&mdash;Dano-Norwegian. But he
was unequal to the task:</p>

<div class = "verse">
At være eller ikke være, det<br>
problemet er: Om det er større av<br>
en sjæl at taale skjæbnens pil og slynge<br>

</div>


<h2>K</h2>

<p>Much more interesting than Blom's attempt, and much more
significant, is a translation and working over of <i>As You Like It</i>
which appeared in November of the same year. The circumstances
under which this translation were made are interesting.
Fru Johanne Dybwad, one of the "stars" at the National Theater
was completing her twenty-fifth year of service on the stage, and
the theater wished to commemorate the event in a manner worthy
of the actress. For the gala performance, Herman Wildenvey,
a poet of the young Norway, made a new translation and adaptation
of <i>As You Like It</i>.<a name = "tag1_38"
href = "#note1_38"><sup>I.38</sup></a> And no choice could have been more
felicitous. Fru Dybwad had scored her greatest success as Puck;
the life and sparkle and jollity of that mischievous wight seemed
like a poetic glorification of her own character. It might be expected,
then, that she would triumph in the rôle of Rosalind.</p>

<p>Then came the problem of a stage version. A simple cutting
of Lembcke seemed inappropriate to this intensely modern
woman. There was danger, too, that Lembcke's faithful Danish
would hang heavy on the light and sparkling Norwegian. Herman
Wildenvey undertook to prepare an acting version that should
fit the actress and the occasion. The result is the text before us.
For the songs and intermissions, Johan Halvorsen, Kapelmester of
the theater, composed new music and the theater provided a
magnificent staging. The tremendous stage-success of Wildenvey's
<i>As You Like It</i> belongs rather to stage history, and for the
present we shall confine ourselves to the translation itself.</p>

<p>First, what of the cutting? In a short introduction the translator
has given an apologia for his procedure. It is worth quoting
at some length. "To adapt a piece of literature is, as a rule,
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
not especially commendable. And now, I who should be the last
to do it, have become the first in this country to attempt anything
of the sort with Shakespeare.</p>

<p>"I will not defend myself by saying that most of Shakespeare's
plays require some sort of adaptation to the modern stage if they
are to be played at all. But, as a matter of fact, I have done little
adapting. I have dusted some of the speeches, maltreated others,
and finally cut out a few which would have sputtered out of the
mouths of the actors like fringes of an old tapestry. But, above
all, I have tried to reproduce the imperishable woodland spirit,
the fresh breath of out-of-doors which permeates this play."</p>

<p>Wildenvey then states that in his cuttings he has followed the
edition of the British Empire Shakespeare Society. But the performance
in Kristiania has demanded more, "and my adaptation
could not be so wonderfully ideal. <i>As You Like It</i> is, probably
more than any other of Shakespeare's plays, a jest and only in part
a play. Through the title he has given his work, he has given me
the right to make my own arrangement which is accordingly, yours
truly <i>As You Like It</i>."</p>

<p>But the most cursory examination will show that this is more
than a mere "cutting." In the first place, the five acts have been
cut to four and scenes widely separated, have often been brought
together. In this way unnecessary scene-shifts have been avoided.
But the action has been kept intact and only two characters have
been eliminated: Jacques de Bois, whose speeches have been given
to Le Beau, and Hymen, whose rôle has been given to Celia. Two
or three speeches have been shifted. But to a reader unacquainted
with Shakespeare all this would pass unnoticed, as would also,
doubtless, the serious cutting and the free translation.</p>

<p>A brief sketch of Wildenvey's arrangement will be of service.</p>

In Wildenvey this is all one scene.<br>
Opens with a rhapsodical conversation between the

banished duke and Amiens on the glories of nature and
the joys of out-door life. It is fully in Shakespeare's
tone, but Wildenvey's own invention. After this
the scene continues with II,&nbsp;1. The first lord's
speech in Wildenvey, however, is merely a free
adaptation of the original, and the later speech of
the first lord, describing Jacques' reveries on the
hunt, is put into the mouth of Jacques himself.
A few entirely new speeches follow and the company
goes out upon the hunt.<br>
There is then a slight pause, but no scene division,
and Shakespeare's II,&nbsp;4 follows. This is succeeded
again without a break, by II,&nbsp;5, II,&nbsp;6, and II,&nbsp;7 (the
opening of II,&nbsp;7 to the entrance of Jacques, is
omitted altogether) to the end of the act.

<p>A study of this scheme shows that Wildenvey has done no
great violence to the fable nor to the characters. His shifts and
changes are sensible enough. In the treatment of the text, however,
he has had no scruples. Shakespeare is mercilessly cut
and mangled.</p>

<p>The ways in which this is done are many. A favorite device
is to break up long speeches into dialogue. To make this possible
he has to put speeches of his own invention into the mouths of
other characters. The opening of the play gives an excellent
illustration. In Wildenvey we read:</p>

<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Orlando:</span>
(kommer ind med tjeneren Adam)<br>
Nu kan du likesaa godt faa vite hvordan alle mine bedrøveligheter
begynder, Adam! Min salig far testamenterte mig nogen fattige
tusen kroner og paala uttrykkelig min bror at gi mig en standsmæssig
opdragelse. Men se hvordan han opfylder sin broderpligt mot
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
mig! Han lar min bror Jacques studere, og rygtet melder om hans
store fremgang. Men mig underholder han hjemme, det vil si, han
holder mig hjemme uten at underholde mig. For man kan da vel
ikke kalde det at underholde en adelsmand som ellers regnes for at
staldfore en okse!
</div>
<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Adam:</span>
Det er synd om Eder, herre, I som er min gamle herres bedste søn!
Men jeg tjener Eders bror, og er alene tjener...
</div>
<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Orl:</span>
Her hos ham har jeg ikke kunnet lægge mig til noget andet end
vækst, og det kan jeg være ham likesaa forbunden for som hans
husdyr hist og her. Formodentlig er det det jeg har arvet av min
fars aand som gjør oprør mot denne behandling. Jeg har ingen
utsigt til nogen forandring til det bedre, men hvad der end hænder,
vil jeg ikke taale det længer.
</div>

<p>Orlando's speech, we see, has been broken up into two, and between the
two new speeches has been interpolated a speech by Adam which does not
occur in the original. The same trick is resorted to repeatedly. Note,
for instance, Jacques first speech on the deer (Act II,&nbsp;7) and
Oliver's long speech in IV,&nbsp;3. The purpose of this is plain
enough&mdash;to enliven the dialogue and speed up the action. Whether or
not it is a legitimate way of handling Shakespeare is another matter.</p>

<p>More serious than this is Wildenvey's trick of adding whole
series of speeches. We have noted in our survey of the "bearbeidelse"
that the second act opens with a dialogue between the
Duke and Amiens which is a gratuitous addition of Wildenvey's.
It is suggested by the original, but departs from it radically both in
form and content.</p>

<p>A careful comparison of the translation with the original will reveal
certain verbal resemblances, <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'notaby'">notably</ins> in the duke's speech:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Din spøk er vel en saadan sanger værd, etc.
</div>

<p>But, even allowing for that, it is a rephrasing rather than a
translation. The stage action, too, is changed. Notice that Jacques
appears in the scene, and that in the episode immediately following,
the second part of the first lord's speech is put into Jacques'
mouth. In other words, he is made to caricature himself!</p>

<p>This is Wildenvey's attitude throughout. To take still another
example. Act IV,&nbsp;2 begins in the English with a brief dialogue in
prose between Jacques and the two lords. In Wildenvey this is
changed to a rhymed dialogue in iambic tetrameters between
Jacques and Amiens. In like manner, the blank verse dialogue
between Silvius and Phebe (Silvius <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'anid'">and</ins> Pippa) is in Norwegian
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
rendered, or rather paraphrased, in iambic verse rhyming regularly
abab.</p>

<p>Occasionally meanings are read into the play which not only
do not belong in Shakespeare but which are ridiculously out of
place. As an illustration, note the dialogue between Orlando and
Rosalind in <ins class = "correction"
title = "so in original">II,&nbsp;2</ins>
(Original, III,&nbsp;2). Orlando remarks: "Your
accent is something finer than could be purchased in so remote a
dwelling." Wildenvey renders this: "Eders sprog er mer elevert
end man skulde vente i disse vilde trakter. De taler ikke Landsmaal."
Probably no one would be deceived by this gratuitous
satire on the Landsmaal, but, obviously, it has no place in what
pretends to be a translation. The one justification for it is that
Shakespeare himself could not have resisted so neat a word-play.</p>

<p>Wildenvey's version, therefore, can only be characterized
as needlessly free. For the text as such he has absolutely no
regard. But for the fact that he has kept the fable and, for the
most part, the characters, intact, we should characterize it as a
belated specimen of Sille Beyer's notorious Shakespeare "bearbeidelser"
in Denmark. But Wildenvey does not take Sille
Beyer's liberties with the dramatis personae and he has, moreover,
what she utterly lacked&mdash;poetic genius.</p>

<p>For that is the redeeming feature of <i>Livet i Skogen</i>&mdash;it
does not translate Shakespeare but it makes him live. The delighted
audience which sat night after night in Christiania and
Copenhagen and drank in the loveliness of Wildenvey's verse and
Halvorsen's music cared little whether the lines that came over
the footlights were philologically an accurate translation or not.
They were enchanted by Norwegian verse and moved to unfeigned
delight by the cleverness of the prose. If Wildenvey did not succeed in
translating <i>As You Like It</i>&mdash;one cannot believe that he ever
intended to,&mdash;he did succeed in reproducing something of "its
imperishable woodland spirit, its fresh breath of out-of-doors."</p>

<p>We have already quoted the opening of Act II. It is not
Shakespeare but it is good poetry in itself. And the immortal
scene between Touchstone and Corin in III,&nbsp;2 (Shak. III,&nbsp;2), in
which Touchstone clearly proves that the shepherd is damned, is
a capital piece of work. The following fragment must serve as
an example:</p>

<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Touchstone:</span>
Har du været ved hoffet, hyrde?
</div>
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Korin:</span>
Visselig ikke.
</div>
<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Touch:</span>
Da er du evig fordømt.
</div>
<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Korin:</span>
Det haaber jeg da ikke.
</div>
<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Touch:</span>
Visselig, da er du fordømt som en sviske.
</div>
<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Korin:</span>
Fordi jeg ikke har været ved hoffet? Hvad mener I?
</div>
<div class = "speech">
<span class = "prosespkr">Touch:</span>
Hvis du ikke har været ved hoffet, saa har du aldrig set gode
seder, og hvis du ikke har set gode seder, saa maa dine seder
være slette, og slette seder er synd, og syndens sold er død og
fordømmelse. Du er i en betænkelig tilstand, hyrde!
</div>

<p>And the mocking verses all rhyming in <i>in-ind</i> in III,&nbsp;3
(Shak. III,&nbsp;2): "From the East to western Ind," etc., are given with
marvelous cleverness:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Fra øst til vest er ei at finde<br>
en ædelsten som Rosalinde.<br>
Al verden om paa alle vinde<br>
skal rygtet gaa om Rosalinde.<br>
Hvor har en maler nogensinde<br>
et kunstverk skapt som Rosalinde?<br>
Al anden deilighet maa svinde<br>
av tanken bort&mdash;for Rosalinde.
</div>

<p>Or Touchstone's parody:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Hjorten skriker efter hinde,<br>
skrik da efter Rosalinde,<br>
kat vil katte gjerne finde,<br>
hvem vil finde Rosalinde.<br>
Vinterklær er tit for tynde,<br>
det er ogsaa Rosalinde.<br>
Nøtten søt har surhamshinde,<br>
slik en nøtt er Rosalinde.<br>
Den som ros' med torn vil finde,<br>
finder den&mdash;og Rosalinde.
</div>

<p>With even greater felicity Wildenvey has rendered the songs
of the play. His verses are not, in any strict sense, translations,
but they have a life and movement which, perhaps, interpret the
original more fully than any translation could interpret it. What
freshness and sparkle in "Under the Greenwood Tree!" I give
only the first stanza:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Under de grønne trær<br>
hvem vil mig møte der?<br>
Hvem vil en tone slaa<br>
frit mot det blide blaa?<br>
Kom hit og herhen, hit og herhen,<br>
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
kom, kjære ven,</div>
<div class = "verse2">
her skal du se,<br>
trær skal du se,</div>
<div class = "verse">
sommer og herlig veir skal du se.
</div>

<p>Or what could be better than the exhilirating text of "Blow, blow,
thou winter wind," as Wildenvey has given it? Again only the first
stanza:</p>

<div class = "verse2">
Blaas, blaas du barske vind,<br>
troløse venners sind<br>
synes os mere raa.<br>
Bar du dig end saa sint,<br>
bet du dog ei saa blindt,<br>
pustet du ogsaa paa.</div>
<div class = "verse">
Heiho! Syng heiho! i vor skog under løvet.<br>
Alt venskap er vammelt, al elskov er tøvet,</div>
<div class = "verse2">
men her under løvet<br>
er ingen bedrøvet.
</div>

<p><i>Livet i Skogen</i>, then, must not be read as a translation of
<i>As You Like It</i>, but is immensely worth reading for its own sake.
Schiller recast and rewrote <i>Macbeth</i> in somewhat the same way,
but Schiller's <i>Macbeth</i>, condemned by its absurd porter-scene, is
today nothing more than a literary curiosity. I firmly believe
that Wildenvey's "bearbeidelse" deserves a better fate. It gave
new life to the Shakespeare tradition on the Norwegian stage,
and is in itself, a genuine contribution to the literature of Norway.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p>If we look over the field of Norwegian translation of Shakespeare,
the impression we get is not one to inspire awe. The
translations are neither numerous nor important. There is
nothing to be compared with the German of Tieck and Schlegel
the Danish of Foersom, or the Swedish of Hagberg.</p>

<p>But the reason is obvious. Down to 1814 Norway was politically
and culturally a dependency of Denmark. Copenhagen was
the seat of government, of literature, and of polite life. To
Copenhagen cultivated Norwegians looked for their models and
their ideals. When Shakespeare made his first appearance in
the Danish literary world&mdash;Denmark and Norway&mdash;it was, of
course, in pure Danish garb. Boye, Rosenfeldt, and Foersom
gave to their contemporaries more or less satisfactory translations
of Shakespeare, and Norwegians were content to accept the Danish
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
versions. In one or two instances they made experiments of their
own. An unknown man of letters translated a scene from <i>Julius
Caesar</i> in 1782, and in 1818 appeared a translation of
<i>Coriolanus</i>.
But there is little that is typically Norwegian about either of
these&mdash;a word or a phrase here and there. For the rest, they are
written in pure Danish, and but for the title-page, no one could tell
whether they were published in Copenhagen or Christiania and
Trondhjem.</p>

<p>In the meantime Foersom had begun his admirable Danish
translations, and the work stopped in Norway. The building
of a nation and literary interests of another character absorbed
the attention of the cultivated world. Hauge's translation of
<i>Macbeth</i> is not significant, nor are those of Lassen thirty years
later. A scholar could, of course, easily show that they are Norwegian,
but that is all. They never succeeded in displacing Foersom-Lembcke.</p>

<p>More important are the Landsmaal translations beginning
with Ivar Aasen's in 1853. They are interesting because they
mark one of the most important events in modern Norwegian
culture&mdash;the language struggle. Ivar Aasen set out to demonstrate
that "maalet" could be used in literature of every sort, and the
same purpose, though in greatly tempered form, is to be detected
in every Landsmaal translation since. Certainly in their outward
aim they have succeeded. And, despite the handicap of
working in a language new, rough, and untried, they have given
to their countrymen translations of parts of Shakespeare which are,
at least, as good as those in "Riksmaal."</p>

<p>Herman Wildenvey stands alone. His work is neither a translation
nor a mere paraphrase; it is a reformulating of Shakespeare
into a new work of art. He has accomplished a feat worth performing,
but it cannot be called translating Shakespeare. It must
be judged as an independent work.</p>

<p><p>Whether Norway is always to go to Denmark for her standard
Shakespeare, or whether she is to have one of her own is, as yet,
a question impossible to answer. A pure Landsmaal translation
cannot satisfy, and many Norwegians refuse to recognize
the Riksmaal as Norwegian at all. In the far, impenetrable
future the language question may settle itself, and when that
happy day comes, but not before, we may look with some confidence
for a "standard" Shakespeare in a literary garb which all Norwegians
will recognize as their own.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER II</h1>

<h2>Shakespeare Criticism in Norway</h2>

<p>The history of Shakespearean translation in Norway cannot,
by any stretch of the imagination, be called distinguished. It is
not, however, wholly lacking in interesting details. In like manner
the history of Shakespearean criticism, though it contains no
great names and no fascinating chapters, is not wholly without
appeal and significance. We shall, then, in the following, consider
this division of our subject.</p>

<p>Our first bit of Shakespearean criticism is the little introductory
note which the anonymous translator of the scenes from
<i>Julius Caesar</i> put at the head of his translation in <i>Trondhjems
Allehaande</i> for October 23, 1782. And even this is a mere statement
that the passage in the original "may be regarded as a masterpiece,"
and that the writer purposes to render not merely
Antony's eloquent appeal but also the interspersed ejaculations
of the crowd, "since these, too, are evidence of Shakespeare's
understanding of the human soul and of his realization of the
manner in which the oration gradually brought about the result
toward which Antony aimed."</p>

<p>This is not profound criticism, to be sure, but it shows clearly
that this litterateur in far-away Trondhjem had a definite, if not
a very new and original, estimate of Shakespeare. It is significant
that there is no hint of apology, of that tone which is so
common in Shakespearean criticism of the day&mdash;Shakespeare was a
great poet, but his genius was wild and untamed. This unknown
Norwegian, apparently, had been struck only by the verity of
the scene, and in that simplicity showed himself a better critic
of Shakespeare than many more famous men. Whoever he was,
his name is lost to us now. He deserves better than to be forgotten,
but it seems that he was forgotten very early. Foersom
refers to him casually, as we have seen, but Rahbek does not mention
him.<a name = "tag2_1" href = "#note2_1"><sup>II.1</sup></a>
Many years later Paul Botten Hansen, one of the
best equipped bookmen that Norway has produced, wrote a
brief review of Lembcke's translation. In the course of this he
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
enumerates the Dano-Norwegian translations known to him.
There is not a word about his countryman in
Trondhjem.<a name = "tag2_2" href = "#note2_2"><sup>II.2</sup></a></p>

<p>After this solitary landmark, a long time passed before we again find
evidence of Shakespearean studies in Norway. The isolated translation of
<i>Coriolanus</i> from 1818 shows us that Shakespeare
was read, carefully and critically read, but no one turned
his attention to criticism or scholarly investigation. Indeed, I
have searched Norwegian periodical literature in vain for any
allusion to Shakespeare between 1782 and 1827. Finally, in
the latter year <i>Den Norske Husven</i> adorns its title-page with a
motto from Shakespeare. <i>Christiania Aftenbladet</i> for July 19,
1828, reprints Carl Bagger's clever poem on Shakespeare's reputed
love-affair with "Fanny," an adventure which got him into
trouble and gave rise to the bon-mot, "William the Conqueror
ruled before Richard III." The poem was reprinted from <i>Kjöbenhavns
Flyvende Post</i> (1828); we shall speak of it again in
connection with our study of Shakespeare in Denmark.</p>

<p>After this there is another break. Not even a reference to
Shakespeare occurs in the hundreds of periodicals I have examined,
until the long silence is broken by a short, fourth-hand article
on Shakespeare's life in <i>Skilling Magazinet</i> for Sept. 23, 1843.
The same magazine gives a similar popular account in its issue for
Sept. 4, 1844. Indeed, several such articles and sketches may
be found in popular periodicals of the years following.</p>

<p>In 1855, however, appeared Niels Hauge's afore mentioned
translation of <i>Macbeth</i>, and shortly afterward Professor Monrad,
who, according to Hauge himself, had at least given him valuable
counsel in his work, wrote a review in <i>Nordisk Tidsskrift for
Videnskab og Literatur</i>.<a name = "tag2_3"
href = "#note2_3"><sup>II.3</sup></a>
Monrad was a pedant, stiff and inflexible,
but he was a man of good sense, and when he was dealing
with acknowledged masterpieces he could be depended upon to
say the conventional things well.</p>

<p>He begins by saying that if any author deserves translation
it is Shakespeare, for in him the whole poetic, romantic ideal of
Protestantism finds expression. He is the Luther of poetry,
though between Luther and Shakespeare there is all the difference
between religious zeal and the quiet contemplation of the beautiful.
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
Both belong to the whole world, Shakespeare because his characters,
humor, art, reflections, are universal in their validity and
their appeal. Wherever he is read he becomes the spokesman
against narrowness, dogmatism, and intolerance. To translate
Shakespeare, he points out, is difficult because of the archaic
language, the obscure allusions, and the intense originality of
the expression. Shakespeare, indeed, is as much the creator as
the user of his mother-tongue. The one translation of <i>Macbeth</i>
in existence, Foersom's, is good, but it is only in part Shakespeare,
and the times require something more adequate and "something
more distinctly our own." Monrad feels that this should not
be altogether impossible "when we consider the intimate relations
between England and Norway, and the further coincidence that
the Norwegian language today is in the same state of flux and
transition, as was Elizabethan English." All translations at
present, he continues, can be but experiments, and should aim
primarily at a faithful rendering of the text. Monrad calls attention
to the fact&mdash;in which he was, of course, mistaken&mdash;that this
is the first translation of the original <i>Macbeth</i> into
Dano-Norwegian or into Danish. It is a work of undoubted merit, though
here and there a little stiff and hazy, "but Shakespeare is not easily
clarified." The humorous passages, thinks the reviewer, are a
severe test of a translator's powers and this test Hauge has met
with conspicuous success. Also he has <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'aquitted'">acquitted</ins> himself well in
the difficult matter of putting Shakespeare's meter into Norwegian.</p>

<p>The last two pages are taken up with a detailed study of
single passages. The only serious error Monrad has noticed is
the following: In Act II,&nbsp;3 one of the murderers calls out "A
light! A light!" Regarding this passage Monrad remarks: "It is
certainly a mistake to have the second murderer call out, "Bring
a light here!" (Lys hid!) The murderer does not demand a light,
but he detects a shimmer from Banquo's approaching torch."
The rest of the section is devoted to mere trifles.</p>

<p>This is the sort of review which we should expect from an
intelligent and well-informed man. Monrad was not a scholar,
nor even a man of delicate and penetrating reactions. But he
had sound sense and perfect self-assurance, which made him something
of a Samuel Johnson in the little provincial Kristiania of
his day. At any rate, he was the only one who took the trouble
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
to review Hauge's translation, and even he was doubtless led
to the task because of his personal interest in the translator.
If we may judge from the stir it made in periodical literature,
<i>Macbeth</i> fell dead from the press.</p>

<p>The tercentenary of Shakespeare's birth (1864) aroused a
certain interest in Norway, and little notes and articles are not
infrequent in the newspapers and periodicals about that time.
<i>Illustreret Nyhedsblad</i><a name = "tag2_4"
href = "#note2_4"><sup>II.4</sup></a> has a short,
popular article on Stratford-on-Avon.
It contains the usual Shakespeare apocrypha&mdash;the Sir
Thomas Lucy story, the story of the apple tree under which
Shakespeare and his companions slept off the effects of too much
Bedford ale&mdash;and all the rest of it. It makes no pretense of
being anything but an interesting hodge-podge for popular consumption.
The next year, 1864, the same periodical
published<a name = "tag2_5" href = "#note2_5"><sup>II.5</sup></a>
on the traditional day of Shakespeare's birth a rather long and
suggestive article on the English drama before Shakespeare. If this
article had been original, it might have had a certain significance,
but, unfortunately, it is taken from the German of Bodenstedt.
The only significant thing about it is the line following
the title: "Til Erindring paa Trehundredsaarsdagen efter Shakespeares
Födsel, d. 23 April, 1563."</p>

<p>More interesting than this, however, are the verses written
by the then highly esteemed poet, Andreas Munch, and published
in his own magazine, <i>For Hjemmet</i>,<a name = "tag2_6"
href = "#note2_6"><sup>II.6</sup></a> in April, 1864. Munch rarely
rises above mediocrity and his tribute to the bard of Avon is
the very essence of it. He begins:</p>

<div class = "verse">
I disse Dage gaar et vældigt Navn<br>
Fra Mund til Mund, fra Kyst til Kyst rundt Jorden&mdash;<br>
Det straaler festligt over fjernest Havn,<br>
Og klinger selv igjennem Krigens Torden,<br>
Det slutter alle Folk i Aandens Favn,<br>
Og er et Eenheds Tegn i Striden vorden&mdash;<br>
I Stjerneskrift det staaer paa Tidens Bue,<br>
Og leder Slægterne med Hjertelue.
</div>

<p>and, after four more stanzas, he concludes:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Hos os har ingen ydre Fest betegnet<br>
Vort Folks Tribut til denne store Mand.<br>
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
Er vi af Hav og Fjelde saa omhegnet,<br>
At ei hans Straaler trænge til os kan?<br>
Nei,&mdash;Nordisk var hans Aand og netop egnet<br>
Til at opfattes af vort Norden-Land,<br>
Og mer maaske end selv vi tro og tænke,<br>
Har Shakespeare brudt for os en fremmed Lænke.
</div>

<p>One has a feeling that Munch awoke one morning, discovered
from his calendar that Shakespeare's birthday was approaching,
and ground out this poem to fill space in <i>Hjemmet</i>. But his
intentions are good. No one can quarrel with the content. And
when all is said, he probably expressed, with a fair degree of
accuracy, the feeling of his time. It remains but to note a detail
or two. First, that the poet, even in dealing with Shakespeare,
found it necessary to draw upon the prevailing "Skandinavisme"
and label Shakespeare "Nordisk"; second, the accidental truth
of the closing couplet. If we could interpret this as referring to
Wergeland, who <i>did</i> break the chains of foreign bondage, and gave
Norway a place in the literature of the world, we should have the
first reference to an interesting fact in Norwegian literary history.
But doubtless we have no right to credit Munch with any such
acumen. The couplet was put into the poem merely because it
sounded well.</p>

<p>More important than this effusion of bad verse from the
poet of fashion was a little article which Paul Botten Hansen
wrote in <i>Illustreret Nyhedsblad</i><a name = "tag2_7"
href = "#note2_7"><sup>II.7</sup></a>
in 1865. Botten Hansen had a
fine literary appreciation and a profound knowledge of books.
The effort, therefore, to give Denmark and Norway a complete
translation of Shakespeare was sure to meet with his sympathy.
In 1861 Lembcke began his revision of Foersom's work, and,
although it must have come up to Norway from Copenhagen almost
immediately, no allusion to it is found in periodical literature
till Botten Hansen wrote his review of Part (Hefte) XI. This
part contains <i>King John</i>. The reviewer, however, does not enter
upon any criticism of the play or of the translation; he gives
merely a short account of Shakespearean translation in the two
countries before Lembcke. Apparently the notice is written
without special research, for it is far from complete, but it gives,
at any rate, the best outline of the subject which we have had up
to the present. Save for a few lines of praise for Foersom and a
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
word for Hauge, "who gave the first accurate translation of this
masterpiece (<i>Macbeth</i>) of which Dano-Norwegian literature can
boast before 1861," the review is simply a loosely connected
string of titles. Toward the close Botten Hansen writes: "When
to these plays (the standard Danish translations) we add (certain
others, which are given), we believe that we have enumerated all
the Danish translations of Shakespeare." This investigation
has shown, however, that there are serious gaps in the list. Botten
Hansen calls Foersom's the first Danish translation of Shakespeare.
It is curious that he should have overlooked Johannes Boye's
<i>Hamlet</i> of 1777, or Rosenfeldt's translation of six plays
(1790-1792). It is less strange that he did not know Sander and Rahbek's
translation of the unaltered <i>Macbeth</i> of 1801&mdash;which preceded
Hauge by half a century&mdash;for this was buried in Sander's lectures.
Nor is he greatly to be blamed for his ignorance of the
numerous Shakespearean fragments which the student may find
tucked away in Danish reviews, from M.C. Brun's <i>Svada</i> (1796)
and on. Botten Hansen took his task very lightly. If he had
read Foersom's notes to his translation he would have found a
clue of interest to him as a Norwegian. For Foersom specifically
refers to a translation of a scene from <i>Julius Caesar</i> in
<i>Trondhjems Allehaande</i>.</p>

<p>Lembcke's revision, which is the occasion of the article, is
greeted with approval and encouragement. There is no need
for Norwegians to go about preparing an independent translation.
Quite the contrary. The article closes: "Whether or not Lembcke
has the strength and endurance for such a gigantic task, time alone
will tell. At any rate, it is the duty of the public to encourage
the undertaking and make possible its completion."</p>

<p>We come now to the most interesting chapter in the history
of Shakespeare in Norway. This is a performance of <i>A&nbsp;Midsummer
Night's Dream</i> under the direction of Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson
at Christiania Theater, April 17, 1865. The story belongs rather
to the history of Shakespeare on the Norwegian stage, but the
documents of the affair are contributions to Shakespearean criticism
and must, accordingly, be discussed here. Bjørnson's fiery
reply to his critics of April 28 is especially valuable as an analysis
of his own attitude toward Shakespeare.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">61</span>
Bjørnson became director of Christiania Theater in January,
1865, and the first important performance under his direction
was <i>A&nbsp;Midsummer Night's Dream</i> (Skjärsommernatsdrömmen)
in <ins class = "correction"
title = "variant spellings in original">Oehlenschläger</ins>'s
translation, with music by Mendelssohn.<a name = "tag2_8"
href = "#note2_8"><sup>II.8</sup></a>
Bjørnson had strained the resources of the theater to the utmost
to give the performance distinction. But the success was doubtful.
<i>Aftenposten</i> found it tiresome, and <i>Morgenbladet</i>, in two
long articles, tore it to shreds.<a name = "tag2_9"
href = "#note2_9"><sup>II.9</sup></a> It is worth while to review the
controversy in some detail.</p>

<p>The reviewer begins by saying that the play is so well known
that it is needless to give an account of it. "But what is the
meaning," he exclaims, "of this bold and poetic mixture of clowns
and fairies, of mythology, and superstition, of high and low, of the
earthly and the supernatural? And the scene is neither Athens
nor Greece, but Shakespeare's own England; it is his own time
and his own spirit." We are transported to an English grove in
early summer with birds, flowers, soft breezes, and cooling shadows.
What wonder that a man coming in from the hunt or the society
of men should fill such a place with fairies and lovely ladies and
people it with sighs, and passions, and stories? And all this has
been brought together by a poet's fine feeling. This it is which
separates the play from so many others of its kind now so common
and often so well presented. Here a master's spirit pervades all,
unites all in lovely romance. Other plays are mere displays of
scenery and costume by comparison. Even the sport of the
clowns throws the whole into stronger relief.</p>

<p>Now, how should such a play be given? Obviously, by actors
of the first order and with costumes and scenery the most splendid.
This goes without saying, for the play is intended quite as much
to be seen as to be heard. To do it justice, the performance must
bring out some of the splendor and the fantasy with which it was
conceived. As we read <i>A&nbsp;Midsummer Night's Dream</i> it is easy
to imagine the glorious succession of splendid scenes, but on the
stage the characters become flesh and blood with fixed limitations,
and the illusion is easily lost unless every agency is used to carry
it out. Hence the need of lights, of rich costumes, splendid backgrounds,
music, rhythm.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">62</span>
The play opens in an apparently uninhabited wood. Suddenly
all comes to life&mdash;gay, full, romantic life. This is the scene to
which we are transported. "It is a grave question," continues
the reviewer, "if it is possible for the average audience to attain
the full illusion which the play demands, and with which, in
reading, we have no difficulty. One thing is certain, the audience
was under no illusion. Some, those who do not pretend to learning
or taste, wondered what it was all about. Only when the
lion moved his tail, or the ass wriggled his ears were they at all
interested. Others were frankly amused from first to last, no
less at Hermia's and Helen's quarrel than at the antics of the clowns.
Still others, the cultivated minority, were simply indifferent."</p>

<p>The truth is that the performance was stiff and cold. Not
for an instant did it suggest the full and passionate life which
is the theme and the background of the play. Nor is this strange.
<i>A&nbsp;Midsummer Night's Dream</i> is plainly beyond the powers of our
theatre. Individual scenes were well done, but the whole was a
cheerless piece of business.</p>

<p>The next day the same writer continues his analysis. He
points out that the secret of the play is the curious interweaving
of the real world with the supernatural. Forget this but for a
moment, and the piece becomes an impossible monstrosity without
motivation or meaning. Shakespeare preserves this unity in
duality. The two worlds seem to meet and fuse, each giving
something of itself to the other. But this unity was absent from
the performance. The actors did not even know their lines, and
thus the spell was broken. The verse must flow from the lips
in a limpid stream, especially in a fairy play; the words must never
seem a burden. But even this elementary rule was ignored in
our performance. And the ballet of the fairies was so bad that
it might better have been omitted. Puck should not have been
given by a woman, but by a boy as he was in Shakespeare's day.
Only the clown scenes were unqualifiedly good, "as we might
expect," concludes the reviewer sarcastically.</p>

<p>The article closes with a parting shot at the costuming and
the scenery. Not a little of it was inherited from "Orpheus in
the Lower World." Are we so poor as that? Better wait, and
for the present, give something which demands less of the theatre.
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
The critic grants that the presentation may prove profitable but,
on the whole, Bjørnson must feel that he has assisted at the mutilation
of a master.</p>

<p>Bjørnson did not permit this attack to go unchallenged.
He was not the man to suffer in silence, and in this case he could
not be silent. His directorate was an experiment, and there were
those in Christiania who were determined to make it unsuccessful.
It was his duty to set malicious criticism right. He did so in
<i>Aftenbladet</i><a name = "tag2_10"
href = "#note2_10"><sup>II.10</sup></a>
in an article which not only answered a bit of
ephemeral criticism but which remains to this day an almost
perfect example of Bjørnson's polemical prose&mdash;fresh, vigorous,
genuinely eloquent, with a marvelous fusing of power and fancy.</p>

<p>He begins with an analysis of the play: The play is called
a dream. But wherein lies the dream? 'Why,' we are told, 'in
the fact that fairies sport, that honest citizens, with and without
asses' heads, put on a comedy, that lovers pursue each other in
the moonlight.' But where is the law in all this? If the play is
without law (Lov = organic unity), it is without validity.</p>

<p>But it does have artistic validity. The dream is more than
a fantasy. The same experiences come to all of us. "The play
takes place, now in your life, now in mine. A young man happily
engaged or happily married dreams one night that this is all a
delusion. He must be engaged to, he must marry another. The
image of the 'chosen one' hovers before him, but he can not quite
visualize it, and he marries with a bad conscience. Then he
awakens and thanks God that it is all a bad dream (Lysander).
Or a youth is tired of her whom he adored for a time. He even
begins to flirt with another. And then one fine night he dreams
that he worships the very woman he loathes, that he implores
her, weeps for her, fights for her (Demetrius). Or a young girl,
or a young wife, who loves and is loved dreams, that her beloved
is fleeing from her. When she follows him with tears and petitions,
he lifts his hand against her. She pursues him, calls to
him to stop, but she cannot reach him. She feels all the agony
of death till she falls back in a calm, dreamless sleep. Or she
dreams that the lover she cannot get comes to her in a wood and
tells her that he really does love her, that her eyes are lovelier
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
than the stars, her hands whiter than the snow on Taurus. But
other visions come, more confusing. Another, whom she has
never given a thought, comes and tells her the same story. His
protestations are even more glowing&mdash;and it all turns to contention
and sorrow, idle pursuit and strife, till her powers fail (Helena).</p>

<p>"This is the dream chain of the lovers. The poet causes
the man to dream that he is unfaithful, or that he is enamored of
one whom he does not love. And he makes the woman dream
that she is deserted or that she is happy with one whom she cannot
get. And together these dreams tell us: watch your thoughts,
watch your passions, you, walking in perfect confidence at the side
of your beloved. They (the thoughts and passions) may bring
forth a flower called 'love in idleness'&mdash;a flower which changes
before you are aware of it. The dream gives us reality reversed,
but reversed in such a way that there is always the possibility
that it may, in an unguarded moment, take veritable shape.</p>

<p>"And this dream of the lovers is given a paradoxical counterpart.
A respectable, fat citizen dreams one night that he is to experience
the great triumph of his life. He is to be presented before
the duke's throne as the greatest of heroes. He dreams that
he cannot get dressed, that he cannot get his head attended to,
because, as a matter of fact, his head is not his own excellent head,
but the head of an ass with long ears, a snout, and hair that itches.
'This is exactly like a fairy tale of my youth,' he dreams. And
indeed, it is a dream! The mountain opens, the captive princess
comes forth and leads him in, and he rests his head in her lap all
strewn with blossoms. The lovely trolls come and scratch his
head and music sounds from the rocks. It is characteristic of
Shakespeare that the lovers do not dream fairy tales of their
childhood. Higher culture has given them deeper passions, more
intense personal relations; in dreams they but continue the life
of waking. But the good weaver who lives thoroughly content
in his own self-satisfaction and in the esteem of his neighbors, who
has never reflected upon anything that has happened to him,
but has received each day's blessings as they have come&mdash;this
man sees, the moment he lays his head on the pillow, the fairies
and the fairy queen. To him the whole circle of childhood fantasy
reveals itself; nothing is changed, nothing but this absurd ass's
head which he wears, and this curious longing for dry, sweet hay.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">65</span>
"This is the dream and the action of the play. Superficially, all this
magic is set in motion by the fairies; Theseus and his train, with whom
come hunting horn and hunting talk and processional&mdash;are,
in reality, the incarnation of the festival. And
the comedy at the close is added by way of counterpiece to the
light, delicate fancies of the dream. It is the thoughts we have
thought, the painfully-wrought products of the waking mind,
given in a sparkle of mocking laughter against the background of
nightly visions. See the play over and over again. Do not
study it with Bottom's ass's head, and do not be so blasé that
you reject the performance because it does not command the
latest electrical effects."</p>

<p>Bjørnson then proceeds to discuss the staging. He admits
by implication that the machinery and the properties are not
so elaborate as they sometimes are in England, but points out
that the equipment of Christiania Theater is fully up to that which,
until a short time before, was considered entirely adequate in the
great cities of Europe. And is machinery so important? The
cutting of the play used at this performance was originally made
by Tieck for the court theater at Potsdam. From Germany it
was brought to Stockholm, and later to Christiania. "The spirit
of Tieck pervades this adaptation. It is easy and natural. The
spoken word has abundant opportunity to make itself felt, and is
neither overwhelmed by theater tricks nor set aside by machinery.
Tieck, who understood stage machinery perfectly, gave it free
play where, as in modern operas, machinery is everything. The
same is true of Mendelssohn. His music yields reverently to
the spoken word. It merely accompanies the play like a new
fairy who strews a strain or two across the stage before his companions
enter, and lends them wings by which they may again
disappear. Only when the words and the characters who utter
them have gone, does the music brood over the forest like a mist
of reminiscence, in which our imagination may once more synthesize
the picture of what has gone before."</p>

<p>Tieck's adaptation is still the standard one. Englishmen
often stage Shakespeare's romantic plays more elaborately. They
even show us a ship at sea in <i>The Tempest</i>. But Shakespeare
has fled England; they are left with their properties, out of which
the spirit of Shakespeare will not rise. It is significant that
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
the most distinguished dramaturg of Germany, Dingelstedt,
planned a few years before to go to London with some of the best actors
in Germany to teach Englishmen how to play Shakespeare once more.</p>

<p>Bjørnson closes this general discussion of scenery and properties
with a word about the supreme importance of imagination
to the playgoer. "I cannot refrain from saying that the
imagination that delights in the familiar is stronger and healthier
than that which loses itself in longings for the impossible.
To visualize on the basis of a few and simple suggestions&mdash;that
is to possess imagination; to allow the images to dissolve and
dissipate&mdash;that is to have no imagination at all. Every allusion has
a definite relation to the familiar, and if our playgoers cannot,
after all that has been given here for years, feel the least illusion
in the presence of the properties in <i>A&nbsp;Midsummer Night's Dream</i>,
then it simply means that bad critics have broken the spell."
Why should Norwegians require an elaborate wood-scene to be
transported to the living woods? A boulevardier of Paris, indeed,
might have need of it, but not a Norwegian with the great
forests at his very doors. And what real illusion is there in a
waterfall tumbling over a painted curtain, or a ship tossing about
on rollers? Does not such apparatus rather destroy the illusion?
"The new inventions of stage mechanicians are far from being
under such perfect control that they do not often ruin art. We
are in a period of transition. Why should we here, who are obliged
to wait a long time for what is admittedly satisfactory, commit
all the blunders which mark the way to acknowledged perfection?"</p>

<p>It would probably be difficult to find definite and tangible
evidence of Shakespeare's influence in Bjørnson's work, and we are,
therefore, doubly glad to have his own eloquent acknowledgement
of his debt to Shakespeare. The closing passus of Bjørnson's
article deserves quotation for this reason alone. Unfortunately
I cannot convey its warm, illuminating style: "Of all
the poetry I have ever read, Shakespeare's <i>A&nbsp;Midsummer Night's
Dream</i> has, unquestionably, had the greatest influence upon me.
It is his most delicate and most imaginative work, appealing quite
as much through its intellectual significance as through its noble,
humane spirit. I read it first in Eiksdal when I was writing
<i>Arne</i>, and I felt rebuked for the gloomy feelings under the spell
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
of which that book was written. But I took the lesson to heart:
I felt that I had in my soul something that could produce a play
with a little of the fancy and joy of <i>A&nbsp;Midsummer Night's
Dream</i>&mdash;and I made resolutions. But the conditions under which
a worker in art lives in Norway are hard, and all we say or promise
avails nothing. But this I know: I am closer to the ideal of this
play now than then, I have a fuller capacity for joy and a greater
power to protect my joy and keep it inviolate. And if, after
all, I never succeed in writing such a play, it means that circumstances
have conquered, and that I have not achieved what I
have ever sought to achieve.</p>

<p>"And one longs to present a play which has been a guiding star to
oneself. I knew perfectly well that a public fresh from <i>Orpheus</i>
would not at once respond, but I felt assured that response
would come in time. As soon, therefore, as I had become
acclimated as director and knew something of the resources of
the theater, I made the venture. This is not a play to be given
toward the end; it is too valuable as a means of gaining that which
is to be the end&mdash;for the players and for the audience. So far as
the actors are concerned, our exertions have been profitable.
The play might doubtless be better presented&mdash;we shall give
it better next year&mdash;but, all in all, we are making progress. You
may call this naivete, poetic innocence, or obstinacy and
arrogance&mdash;whatever it is, this play is of great moment to me, for
it is the link which binds me to my public, it is my appeal to the
public. If the public does not care to be led whither this leads,
then I am not the proper guide. If people wish to get me out
of the theater, they may attack me here. Here I am vulnerable."</p>

<p>In <i>Morgenbladet</i> for May 1st the reviewer made a sharp reply.
He insists again that the local theater is not equal to <i>A&nbsp;Midsummer
Night's Dream</i>. But it is not strange that Bjørnson will not
admit his own failure. His eloquent tribute to the play and all
that it has meant to him has, moreover, nothing to do with the
question. All that he says may be true, but certainly such facts
ought to be the very thing to deter him from giving Shakespeare
into the hands of untrained actors. For if Bjørnson feels that
the play was adequately presented, then we are at a loss to understand
how he has been able to produce original work of unquestionable
merit. One is forced to believe that he is hiding a failure
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
behind his own name and fame. After all, concludes the writer,
the director has no right to make this a personal matter. Criticism
has no right to turn aside for injured feelings, and all Bjørnson's
declarations about the passions of the hour have nothing to do with
<ins class = "correction" title = "original omits 'the'">the</ins>
case.</p>

<p>This ended the discussion. At this day, of course, one cannot
pass judgment, and there is no reason why we should. The two
things which stand out are Bjørnson's protest against spectacular
productions of Shakespeare's plays, and his ardent, almost passionate
tribute to him as the poet whose influence had been greatest
in his life.</p>

<p>And then there is a long silence. Norwegian periodicals&mdash;there
is not to this day a book on Shakespeare by a Norwegian&mdash;contain
not a single contribution to Shakespearean criticism till
1880, when a church paper, <i>Luthersk Ugeskrift</i><a name = "tag2_11"
href = "#note2_11"><sup>II.11</sup></a> published an
article which proved beyond cavil that Shakespeare is good and
safe reading for Lutheran Christians. The writer admits that
Shakespeare probably had several irregular love-affairs both
before and after marriage, but as he grew older his heart turned
to the comforts of religion, and in his epitaph he commends his
soul to God, his body to the dust. Shakespeare's extreme objectivity
makes snap judgments unsafe. We cannot always be sure
that his characters voice his own thoughts and judgments, but,
on the other hand, we have no right to assume that they never
do. The tragedies especially afford a safe basis for judgment, for
in them characterization is of the greatest importance. No great
character was ever created which did not spring from the poet's
own soul. In Shakespeare's characters sin, lust, cruelty, are
always punished; sympathy, love, kindness are everywhere glorified.
The writer illustrates his meaning with copious quotations.</p>

<p>Apparently the good Lutheran who wrote this article felt
troubled about the splendor which Shakespeare throws about the
Catholic Church. But this is no evidence, he thinks, of any special
sympathy for it. Many Protestants have been attracted
by the pomp and circumstance of the Catholic Church, and they
have been none the worse Protestants for that. The writer had
the good sense not to make Shakespeare a Lutheran but, for the
rest, the article is a typical example of the sort of criticism that
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
has made Shakespeare everything from a pious Catholic to a
champion of atheistic democracy. If, however, the readers of <i>Luthersk
Ugeskrift</i> were led to read Shakespeare after being assured
that they might do so safely, the article served a useful purpose.</p>

<p>Eight years later the distinguished litterateur and critic, Just Bing,
wrote in <i>Vidar</i><a name = "tag2_12"
href = "#note2_12"><sup>II.12</sup></a>,
one of the best periodicals that Norway has
ever had, a brief character study of Ophelia, which, though it contains
nothing original, stands considerably higher as literary
criticism than anything we have yet considered, with the sole
exception of Bjørnson's article in <i>Aftenbladet</i>, twenty-three years
earlier.</p>

<p>Bing begins by defining two kinds of writers. First, those
whose power is their keen observation. They see things accurately
and they secure their effects by recording just what they see.
Second, those writers who do not merely see external phenomena
with the external eye, but who, through a miraculous intuition,
go deeper into the soul of man. <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'Moliére'">Molière</ins> is the classical example
of the first type; Shakespeare of the second. To him a chance utterance
reveals feelings, passions, whole lives&mdash;though he probably
never developed the consequences of a chance remark to their
logical conclusion without first applying to them close and searching
rational processes. But it is clear that if a critic is to analyze
a character of Shakespeare's, he must not be content merely to
observe. He must feel with it, live with it. He must do so with
special sympathy in the case of Ophelia.</p>

<p>The common characteristic of Shakespeare's women is their
devotion to the man of their choice and their confidence that this
choice is wise and happy. The tragedy of Ophelia lies in the
fact that outward evidence is constantly shocking that faith.
Laertes, in his worldly-wise fashion, first warns her. She cries
out from a broken heart though she promises to heed the warning.
Then comes Polonius with his cunning wisdom. But Ophelia's
faith is still unshaken. She promises her father, however, to be
careful, and her caution, in turn, arouses the suspicion of Hamlet.
Even after his wild outburst against her he still loves her.
He begs her to believe in him and to remember him in her prayers.
But suspicion goes on. Ophelia is caught between devotion and
duty, and the grim events that crowd upon her plunge her to
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
sweet, tragic death. Nothing could be more revealing than our
last glimpse of her. Shakespeare's intuitive knowledge of the
soul was sure. The determining fact of her life was her love for
Hamlet: it is significant that when we see her insane not a mention
of it crosses her lips.</p>

<p>Hamlet and Ophelia are the delicate victims of a tragic necessity.
They are undone because they lose confidence in those to
whom they cling with all the abandon of deep, spiritual souls.
Hamlet is at last aroused to desperation; Ophelia is helplessly
crushed. She is the finest woman of Shakespeare's imagination,
and perhaps for that reason the most difficult to understand and
the one least often appreciated.</p>

<p>The next chapter in Norwegian Shakespeareana is a dull, unprofitable
one&mdash;a series of articles on the Baconian theory appearing
irregularly in the monthly magazine, <i>Kringsjaa</i>. The first
article appeared in the second volume (1894) and is merely a
review of a strong pro-Bacon outburst in the American <i>Arena</i>. It
is not worth criticising. Similar articles appeared in <i>Kringsjaa</i>
in 1895, the material this time being taken from the <i>Deutsche
Revue</i>. It is the old ghost, the cipher in the first folio, though
not Ignatius Donnelly's cryptogram. Finally, in 1898, a new
editor, Chr. Brinckmann,
printed<a name = "tag2_13"
href = "#note2_13"><sup>II.13</sup></a>
a crushing reply to all these
cryptogram fantasies. And that is all that was ever published
in Norway on a foolish controversy.</p>

<p>It is a relief to turn from puerilities of this sort to Theodor
Caspari's article in <i>For Kirke og Kultur</i>
(1895)<a name = "tag2_14"
href = "#note2_14"><sup>II.14</sup></a>&mdash;<i>Grunddrag
ved den Shakespeareske Digtning, i særlig Jevnförelse med Ibsens
senere Digtning</i>.</p>

<p>This article must be read with caution, partly because its
analysis of the Elizabethan age is conventional, and therefore
superficial, and partly because it represents a direction of thought
which eyed the later work of Ibsen and Bjørnson with distrust.
These men had rejected the faith of their fathers, and the books that
came from them were signs of the apostasy. But <i>For Kirke og Kultur</i>
has been marked from its first number by ability, conspicuous
fairness, and a large catholicity, which give it an honorable
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
place among church journals. And not even a fanatical admirer
of Ibsen will deny that there is more than a grain of truth in the
indictment which the writer of this article brings against him.</p>

<p>The central idea is the large, general objectivity of Shakespeare's
plays as contrasted with the narrow, selfish subjectivity of Ibsen's.
The difference bottoms in the difference between the age
of Elizabeth and our own. Those were days of full, pulsing,
untrammeled life. Men lived big, physical lives. They had
few scruples and no nerves. Full-blooded passions, not petty
problems of pathological psychology, were the things that interested
poets and dramatists. They saw life fully and they saw it
whole. So with Shakespeare. His characters are big, well-rounded
men; they are not laboratory specimens. They live in
the real Elizabethan world, not in the hothouse of the poet's
brain. It is of no consequence that violence is done to "local
color." Shakespeare beheld all the world and all ages through
the lens of his own time and country, but because the men he
saw were actual, living beings, the characters he gives us, be they
mythological figures, Romans, Greeks, Italians, or Englishmen,
have universal validity. He went to Italy for his greatest love-story.
That gave him the right atmosphere. It is significant
that Ibsen once thought it necessary to seek a suggestive background
for one of his greatest characters. He went to Finmarken
for Rebecca West.</p>

<p>Shakespeare's characters speak in loud, emphatic tones and
they give utterance to clear, emphatic thoughts. There is no
"twilight zone" in their thinking. Ibsen's men and women,
like the children at Rosmersholm, never speak aloud; they merely
whimper or they whisper the polite innuendos of the drawing room.
The difference lies largely in the difference of the age. But Ibsen
is more decadent than his age. There are great ideas in our time
too, but Ibsen does not see them. He sees only the "thought."
Contrast with this Shakespeare's colossal scale. He is "loud-voiced"
but he is also "many-voiced." Ibsen speaks in a salon
voice and always in one key. And the remarkable thing is that
Shakespeare, in spite of his complicated plots, is always clear.
The main lines of the action stand out boldly. There is always
speed and movement&mdash;a speed and movement directly caused
by powerful feelings. He makes his readers think on a bigger
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
scale than does Ibsen. His passions are sounder because they
are larger and more expansive.</p>

<p>Shakespeare is the dramatist of our average life; Ibsen, the
poet of the rare exception. To Shakespeare's problems there is
always an answer; underneath his storms there is peace, not merely filth
and doubt. There is even a sense of a greater power&mdash;calm
and immovable as history itself. Ibsen's plays are nervous,
hectic, and unbelieving. In the words of Rosmer: "Since there
is no judge over us, we must hold a judgment day for ourselves."
Contrast this with Hamlet's soliloquy. And, finally, one feels
sure in Shakespeare that the play means something. It has a
beginning and an end. "What shall we say of plays like Ibsen's,
in which Act I and Act II give no clue to Act III, and where both
question and answer are hurled at us in the same speech?"</p>

<p>In the same year, 1895, Georg Brandes published in
<i>Samtiden</i>,<a name = "tag2_15"
href = "#note2_15"><sup>II.15</sup></a>
at that time issued in Bergen, two articles on <i>Shakespeare's Work
in his Period of Gloom</i> (Shakespeare i hans Digtnings mørke
Periode) which embody in compact form that thesis since elaborated
in his big work. Shakespeare's tragedies were the outcome
of a deep pessimism that had grown for years and culminated
when he was about forty. He was tired of the vice, the hollowness,
the ungratefulness, of life. The immediate cause must
remain unknown, but the fact of his melancholy seems clear
enough. His comedy days were over and he began to portray
a side of life which he had hitherto kept hidden. <i>Julius Caesar</i>
marks the transition. In Brutus we are reminded that high-mindedness
in the presence of a practical situation often fails,
and that practical mistakes are often as fatal as moral ones.
From Brutus, Shakespeare came to Hamlet, a character in
transition from fine youth, full of illusions, to a manhood whose
faith is broken by the hard facts of the world. This is distinctly
autobiographical. <i>Hamlet</i> and Sonnet 66 are of one piece.
Shakespeare was disillusioned. Add to this his struggle against
his enemy, Puritanism, and a growing conviction that the miseries
of life bottom in ignorance, and the reason for his growing
pessimism becomes clear. From Hamlet, whom the world crushes,
to Macbeth, who faces it with its own weapons, yet is haunted and
<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
terrified by what he does, the step is easy. He knew Macbeth
as he knew Hamlet.</p>

<p>The scheming Iago, too, he must have known, for he has
portrayed him with matchless art. "But <i>Othello</i> was a mere
monograph; <i>Lear</i> is a cosmic picture. Shakespeare turns from
<i>Othello</i> to <i>Lear</i> in consequence of the necessity which the
poet
feels to supplement and round out his beginning." <i>Othello</i> is
noble chamber music; <i>Lear</i> is a symphony played by a gigantic
orchestra. It is the noblest of all the tragedies, for in it are all
the storm and tumult of life, all that was struggling and raging
in his own soul. We may feel sure that the ingratitude he had met
with is reflected in Goneril and Regan. Undoubtedly, in the
same way, the poet had met the lovely Cleopatra and knew what
it was to be ensnared by her.</p>

<p>Brandes, as has often been pointed out, did not invent this
theory of Shakespeare's psychology but he elaborated it with a
skill and persuasiveness which carried the uncritical away.</p>

<p>In his second article Brandes continues his analysis of Shakespeare's
pessimism. In the period of the great tragedies there can
be no doubt that Shakespeare was profoundly pessimistic. There
was abundant reason for it. The age of Elizabeth was an age of
glorious sacrifices, but it was also an age of shameless hypocrisy,
of cruel and unjust punishments, of downright oppression. Even
the casual observer might well grow sick at heart. A nature so
finely balanced as Shakespeare's suffered a thousandfold. Hence
this contempt for life which showed only corruption and injustice.
Cressida and Cleopatra are sick with sin and evil; the men are mere
fools and brawlers.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, a feeling that he is being set aside for younger
men. We find clear expression of this in <i>All's Well That Ends
Well</i>, in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>. There is, too, in <i>Troilus
and Cressida</i> a speech which shows the transition to the mood of
<i>Coriolanus</i>, an aristocratic contempt for the mass of mankind.
This is the famous speech in which Ulysses explains the necessity
of social distinctions. Note in this connection Casca's contemptuous
reference to the plebeians, Cleopatra's fear of being shown to
the mob. Out of this feeling grew <i>Coriolanus</i>. The great patrician
lives on the heights, and will not hear of bending to the crowd.
The contempt of Coriolanus grew to the storming rage of Timon.
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
When Coriolanus meets with ingratitude, he takes up arms; Timon
is too supremely indifferent to do even this.</p>

<p>Thus Shakespeare's pessimism grew from grief over the power
of evil (Othello) and misery over life's sorrows, to bitter hatred
(Timon). And when he had raged to the uttermost, something of
the resignation of old age came to him. We have the evidence of
this in his last works. Perhaps, as in the case of his own heroes,
a woman saved him. Brandes feels that the evolution of Shakespeare
as a dramatist is to be traced in his women. We have
first the domineering scold, reminding him possibly of his own
domestic relations (Lady Macbeth); second, the witty, handsome
women (Portia, Rosalind); third, the simple, naive women
(Ophelia, Desdemona); fourth, the frankly sensuous women
(Cleopatra, Cressida); and, finally, the young woman viewed with
all an old man's joy (Miranda). Again his genius exercises
his spell. Then, like Prospero, he casts his magician's staff into
the sea.</p>

<p>In 1896 Brandes published his great work on Shakespeare.
It arrested attention immediately in every country of the world.
Never had a book so fascinating, so brilliant, so wonderfully
suggestive, been written on Shakespeare. The literati were
captivated. But alas, scholars were not. They admitted that
Brandes had written an interesting book, that he had accumulated
immense stores of information and given to these sapless materials
a new life and a new attractiveness. But they pointed out that
not only did his work contain gross positive errors, but it consisted,
from first to last, of a tissue of speculations which, however ingenious,
had no foundation in fact and no place in cool-headed
criticism.<a name = "tag2_16"
href = "#note2_16"><sup>II.16</sup></a> Theodor
Bierfreund, one of the most brilliant Shakespeare
scholars in Denmark, almost immediately attacked Brandes
in a long article in the Norwegian periodical <i>Samtiden</i>.<a name =
"tag2_17" href = "#note2_17"><sup>II.17</sup></a></p>

<p>He acknowledges the great merits of the work. It is an
enormously rich compilation of Shakespeare material gathered
from the four corners of the earth and illuminated by the genius of
a great writer. He gives the fullest recognition to Brandes'
miraculous skill in analyzing characters and making them live
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
before our eyes. But he warns us that Brandes is no critical
student of source materials, and that we must be on our guard in
accepting his conclusions. It is not so certain that the sonnets
mean all that Brandes would have them mean, and it is certain
that we must be cautious in inferring too much from <i>Troilus and
Cressida</i> and <i>Pericles</i> for, in the opinion of the reviewer,
Shakespeare probably had little or nothing to do with them. He then
sketches briefly his theory that these plays cannot be Shakespeare's,
a theory which he later elaborated in his admirably written monograph,
<i>Shakespeare og hans Kunst</i>.<a name = "tag2_18"
href = "#note2_18"><sup>II.18</sup></a>
This, however, belongs to
the study of Shakespearean criticism in Denmark.</p>

<p>So far as I have been able to find, Bierfreund's review was
the only one published in Norway immediately after the publication
of Brandes' work, but in 1899, S. Brettville Jensen took up the
matter again in <i>For Kirke og
Kultur</i><a name = "tag2_19" href = "#note2_19"><sup>II.19</sup></a>
and, in 1901, Christen
Collin vigorously assailed in <i>Samtiden</i> that elaborate and fanciful
theory of the sonnets which plays so great a part in Brandes'
study of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Brettville Jensen praises Brandes highly. He is always
interesting, in harmony with his age, and in rapport with his
reader. "But his book is a fantasy palace, supported by columns
as lovely as they are hollow and insecure, and hovering in rainbow
mists between earth and sky." Brandes has rare skill in
presenting hypotheses as facts. He has attempted to reconstruct
the life of Shakespeare from his works. Now this is a mode
of criticism which may yield valuable results, but clearly it must
be used with great care. Shakespeare knew the whole of life,
but how he came to know it is another matter. Brandes thinks
he has found the secret. Back of every play and every character
there is a personal experience. But this is rating genius altogether
too cheap. One must concede something to the imagination
and the creative ability of the poet. To relate everything
in Shakespeare's dramas to the experiences of Shakespeare the man,
is both fanciful and uncritical.</p>

<p>The same objection naturally holds regarding the meaning
of the sonnets which Brandes has made his own. Here we must
bear in mind the fact that much of the language in the sonnets is
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
purely conventional. We should have a difficult time indeed
determining just how much is biographical and how much belongs
to the stock in trade of Elizabethan sonneteers. Brettville Jensen
points out that if the sonnets are the expression of grief at
the loss of his beloved, it is a queer contradiction that Sonnet 144,
which voices his most poignant sorrow, should date from 1599,
the year, according to Brandes, when Shakespeare's comedy
period began!</p>

<p>It is doubtless true that the plays and even the sonnets mark
great periods in the life of the poet, but we may be sure that the
relation between experience and literary creation was not so
literal as Brandes would have us believe. The change from mood
to mood, from play to play, was gradual, and it never destroyed
Shakespeare's poise and sanity. We shall not judge Shakespeare
rightly if we believe that personal feeling rather than artistic
truth shaped his work.</p>

<p>Two years later Collin, a critic of fine insight and appreciation,
wrote in <i>Samtiden</i><a name = "tag2_20"
href = "#note2_20"><sup>II.20</sup></a>
an article on the sonnets of Shakespeare.
He begins by picturing Shakespeare's surprise if he could rise
from his grave in the little church at Stratford and look upon the
pompous and rather naive bust, and hear the strange tongues of
the thousands of pilgrims at his shrine. Even greater would be his
surprise if he could examine the ponderous tomes in the Shakespeare
Memorial Library at Birmingham which have been written
to explain him and his work. And if any of these volumes could
interest him at all it would doubtless be those in which ingenious
critics have attempted to discover the poet in the plays and the
poems. Collin then gives a brief survey of modern Shakespearean
criticism&mdash;Furnivall, Dowden, Brandl, Boas, ten Brink, and,
more recently, Sidney, Lee, Brandes, and Bierfreund. An important
object of the study of these men has been to fix the chronology
of the plays. They seldom fully agree. Sidney Lee and
the Danish critic, Bierfreund, do not accept the usual theory that
the eight tragedies from <i>Julius Caesar</i> to <i>Coriolanus</i>
reflect a period of gloom and pessimism. In their opinion psychological
criticism has, in this instance, proved a dismal failure.</p>

<p>The battle has raged with particular violence about the sonnets.
Most scholars assume that we have in them a direct presentation
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
(fremstilling) of a definite period in the life of the poet.
And by placing this period directly before the creation of <i>Hamlet</i>,
Brandes has succeeded in making the relations to the "dark lady"
a crisis in Shakespeare's life. The story, which, as Brandes tells
it, has a remarkable similarity to an ultra-modern naturalistic
novel, becomes even more piquant since Brandes knows the name
of the lady, nay, even of the faithless friend. All this information
Brandes has, of course, taken from Thomas Tyler's introduction
to the Irving edition of the sonnets (1890), but his passion for the
familiar anecdote has led him to embellish it with immense enthusiasm
and circumstantiality.</p>

<p>The hypothesis, however, is essentially weak. Collin disagrees
absolutely with Lee that the sonnets are purely conventional,
without the slightest biographical value. Mr. Lee has weakened
his case by admitting that "key-sonnet" No. 144 is autobiographical.
Now, if this be true, then one must assume that the
sonnets set forth Shakespeare's relations to a real man and a real
woman. But the most convincing argument against the Herbert-Fitton
theory lies in the chronology. It is certain that the
sonnet fashion was at its height immediately after the publication
of Sidney's sequence in 1591, and it seems equally certain that
it had fallen off by 1598. This chronology is rendered probable
by two facts about Shakespeare's work. First, Shakespeare
employs the sonnet in dialogue in <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> and
in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. These plays belong to the early nineties.
Second, the moods of the sonnets exactly correspond, on the one
hand, to the exuberant sensuality of <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, on the
other, to the restraint of the <i>Lucrece</i>.</p>

<p>An even safer basis for determining the chronology of the
sonnets Collin finds in the group in which the poet laments his
poverty and his outcast state. If the sonnets are
autobiographical&mdash;and
Collin agrees with Brandes that they are&mdash;then this group
(26, 29, 30, 31, 37, 49, 66, 71-75, 99, 110-112, 116, 119, 120, 123,
and 124) must refer to a time when the poet was wretched, poor,
and obscure. And in this case, the sonnets cannot be placed at
1598-99, when Shakespeare was neither poor nor despised, a time
in which, according to Brandes, he wrote his gayest comedies.</p>

<p>It seems clear from all this that the sonnets cannot be placed
so late as 1598-1600. They do not fit the facts of Shakespeare's
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
life at this time. But they do fit the years from 1591 to 1594,
and especially the years of the plague, 1592-3, when the theaters
were generally closed, and Shakespeare no doubt had to battle
for a mere existence. In 1594 Shakespeare's position became
more secure. He gained the favor of Southampton and dedicated
the <i>Rape of Lucrece</i> to him.</p>

<p>Collin develops at this point with a good deal of fullness his
theory that the motifs of the sonnets recur in <i>Venus and Adonis</i>
and <i>Lucrece</i>&mdash;in <i>Venus and Adonis</i>,
a certain crass naturalism;
in <i>Lucrece</i> a high and spiritual morality. In the sonnets the same
antithesis is found. Compare Sonnet 116&mdash;in praise of
friendship&mdash;with
129, in which is pictured the tyranny and the treachery
of sensual love. These two forces, sensual love and platonic
friendship, were mighty cultural influences during Shakespeare's
apprentice years and the young poet shows plainly that he was
moved by both.</p>

<p>If all this be true, then the Herbert-Fitton theory falls to the
ground, for in 1597 Herbert was only seventeen. But unquestionably
the sonnets are autobiographical. They reveal with a
poignant power Shakespeare's sympathy, his unique ability to
enter into another personality, his capacity of imaginative expansion
to include the lives of others. Compare the noble sonnet
112, which Collin translates:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Din kjærlighed og medynk dækker til<br>

Lad andre tro og sige, hvad de vil,&mdash;<br>

</div>
<div class = "verse">
Saa helt du fylder ut min sjæl herinde,<br>

</div>

<p>At this point the article in <i>Samtiden</i> closes. Collin promises
to give in a later number, a metrical translation of a number of
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
significant sonnets. The promised renderings, however, never
appeared. Thirteen years later, in 1914, the author, in a most
interesting and illuminating book, <i>Det Geniale Menneske</i>,<a name =
"tag2_21" href = "#note2_21"><sup>II.21</sup></a> a
study of "genius" and its relation to civilization, reprinted his
essay in <i>Samtiden</i> and supplemented it with three short chapters.
In the first of these he endeavors to show that in the sonnets
Shakespeare gives expression to two distinct tendencies of the
Renaissance&mdash;the tendency toward a loose and unregulated
gratification of the senses, and the tendency toward an elevated
and platonic conception of friendship. Shakespeare sought in
both of these a compensation for his own disastrous love affair
and marriage. But the healing that either could give was at best
transitory. There remained to him as a poet of genius one resource.
He could gratify his own burning desire for a pure and
unselfish love by living in his mighty imagination the lives of his
characters. "He who in his yearning for the highest joys of
love had been compelled to abandon hope, found a joy mingled
with pain, in giving of his life to lovers in whom the longing of
William Shakespeare lives for all time.</p>

<p>"He has loved and been loved. It was he whom Sylvia,
Hermia, Titania, Portia, Juliet, Beatrice, Rosalind, Viola, and
Olivia loved,&mdash;and Ophelia, Desdemona, Hermione and Miranda."</p>

<p>In the second chapter Collin argues, as he had done in his
essay on <i>Hamlet</i><a name = "tag2_22"
href = "#note2_22"><sup>II.22</sup></a>
that Shakespeare's great tragedies voice no
pessimism, but the stern purpose to strengthen himself and his
contemporaries against the evils and vices of Jacobean England&mdash;that
period of moral and intellectual disintegration which followed
the intense life of the Elizabethan age. Shakespeare battles
against the ills of society as the Greek dramatists had done, by
showing sin and wickedness as destroyers of life, and once this
is done, by firing mankind to resistance against the forces of ruin
and decay. "To hold the mirror up to nature," that men may
see the devastation which evil and vice bring about in the social
body. And to do this he does not, like some modern writers,
shun moralizing. He warns against sensual excess in Adam's
speech in <i>As You Like It</i>, II,&nbsp;3:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
<div class = "verse3">
Let me be your servant;</div>
<div class = "verse">
Though I look old, yet am I strong and lusty;<br>
For in my youth I never did apply<br>
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood;<br>
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo<br>
The means of weakness and debility;
</div>

<p>Or, compare the violent outburst against drunkenness in <i>Hamlet</i>
Act 1, Sc. 4, and the stern warning against the same vice in
<i>Othello</i>, where, indeed, <ins class = "correction"
title = "so in original">Cassius'</ins> weakness for strong drink is the
immediate occasion of the tragic complication. In like manner,
Shakespeare moralizes against lawless love in the <i>Merry Wives</i>,
in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, in <i>Hamlet</i>, in <i>Lear</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Shakespeare never allows artistic scruples
to stand in the way of exalting simple, domestic virtues. Simple
conjugal fidelity is one of the glories of Hamlet's illustrious father
and of the stern, old Roman, Coriolanus; the young prince, Malcolm,
is as chaste and innocent as the young barbarians of whom
Tacitus tells.</p>

<p>In a final section, Collin connects this view of Hamlet which
he has developed in his essay on <i>Hamlet</i> and the Sonnets, with the
theory of human civilization which his book so suggestively
advances.</p>

<p>The great tragedies from <i>Hamlet</i> to <i>Timon of Athens</i> are
not autobiographical in the sense that they are reflections of
Shakespeare's own concrete experience. They are not the record of a
bitter personal pessimism. In the years when they were written
Shakespeare was contented and prosperous. He restored the
fortunes of his family and he was hailed as a master of English
without a peer. It is therefore a priori quite unlikely that the
tragic atmosphere of this period should go back to purely personal
disappointments. The case is more likely this: Shakespeare
had grown in power of sympathy with his fellows and his time.
He had become sensitive to the needs and sorrows of the society
about him. He could put himself in the place of those who are
sick in mind and heart. And in consequence of this he could
preach to this generation the simple gospel of right living and
show to them the psychic weakness whence comes all human
sorrow.</p>

<p>And through this expansion of his ethical consciousness what had he
gained? Not merely a fine insight as in <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>Antony</i>
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<i>and Cleopatra</i>, and <i>Coriolanus</i>, an insight which enables
him to treat with comprehending sympathy even great criminals and
traitors, but a high serenity and steady poise which enables him
to write the romances of his last years&mdash;<i>Cymbeline</i>,
<i>A&nbsp;Winter's Tale</i>, and <i>The Tempest</i>. He had come
to feel that human life,
after all, with its storms, is a little thing, a dream and a fata
morgana, which soon must give place to a permanent reality:</p>

<div class = "verse4">
We are such stuff</div>
<div class = "verse">
As dreams are made of, and our little life<br>
Is rounded with a sleep.
</div>

<p>In 1904 Collin wrote in <i>Nordisk Tidskrift för Vetenskap, Konst
och Industri</i><a name = "tag2_23"
href = "#note2_23"><sup>II.23</sup></a>** a most suggestive
article on Hamlet. He again
dismisses the widely accepted theory of a period of gloom and
increasing pessimism as baseless. The long line of tragedies
cannot be used to prove this. They are the expression of a great
poet's desire to strengthen mankind in the battle of life.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">82</span>
We need dwell but little on Collin's sketch of the "Vorgeschichte"
of <i>Hamlet</i>, for it contributes nothing that is new. <i>Hamlet</i>
was a characteristic "revenge tragedy" like the "Spanish
Tragedy" and a whole host of others which had grown up in
England under the influence, direct and indirect, of Seneca. He
points out in a very illuminating way how admirably the "tragedy
of blood" fitted the times. Nothing is more characteristic of
the renaissance than an intense joy in living. But exactly as the
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
appetite for mere existence became keen, the tragedy of death
gained in power. The most passionate joy instinctively calls
up the most terrible sorrow. There is a sort of morbid caution
here&mdash;a feeling that in the moment of happiness it is well to
harden oneself against the terrible reaction to come. Conversely,
the contemplation of suffering intensifies the joys of the moment.
At all events, in such a time, emotions become stronger, colors are
brighter, and contrasts are more violent. The "tragedy of blood,"
therefore, was more than a learned imitation. Its sound and fury
met the need of men who lived and died intensely.</p>

<p>The primitive <i>Hamlet</i> was such a play. Shakespeare took
over, doubtless with little change, both fable and characters, but
he gave to both a new spiritual content. Hamlet's revenge
gained a new significance. It is no longer a fight against the
murderer of his father, but a battle against "a world out of
joint." No wonder that a simple duty of blood revenge becomes
a task beyond his powers. He sees the world as a mass of faithlessness,
and the weight of it crushes him and makes him sick at
heart. This is the tragedy of Hamlet&mdash;his will is paralyzed and,
with it, his passion for revenge. He fights a double battle, against
his uncle and against himself. The conviction that Shakespeare,
and not his predecessor, has given this turn to the tragedy is sustained
by the other plays of the same period, <i>Lear</i> and <i>Timon of
Athens</i>. They exhibit three different stages of the same disease,
a disease in which man's natural love of fighting is turned against
himself.</p>

<p>Collin denies that the tragedy of Hamlet is that of a contemplative
soul who is called upon to solve great practical problems.
What right have we to assume that Hamlet is a weak,
excessively reflective nature? Hamlet is strong and regal, capable
of great, concrete attainments. But he can do nothing except
by violent and eccentric starts; his will is paralyzed by a fatal
sickness. He suffers from a disease not so uncommon in modern
literature&mdash;the tendency to see things in the darkest light. Is
it far from the pessimism of Hamlet to the pessimism of Schopenhauer
and Tolstoi? Great souls like Byron and Heine and Ibsen
have seen life as Hamlet saw it, and they have struggled as he did,
"like wounded warriors against the miseries of the times."</p>

<p>But from this we must not assume that Shakespeare himself
was pessimistic. To him Hamlet's state of mind was pathological.
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
One might as well say that he was a murderer because he
wrote <i>Macbeth</i>, a misogynist because he created characters like
Isabella and Ophelia, a wife murderer because he wrote <i>Othello</i>,
or a suicide because he wrote <i>Timon of Athens</i> as to say that he
was a pessimist because he wrote <i>Hamlet</i>&mdash;the tragedy of an
irresolute
avenger. This interpretation is contradicted by the very
play itself. "At Hamlet's side is the thoroughly healthy Horatio,
almost a standard by which his abnormality may be measured.
At Lear's side stand Cordelia and Kent, faithful and sound to the
core. If the hater of mankind, Timon, had written a play about
a rich man who was betrayed by his friends, he would unquestionably
have portrayed even the servants as scoundrels. But
Shakespeare never presented his characters as all black. Pathological
states of mind are not presented as normal."</p>

<p>Collin admits, nevertheless, that there may be something
autobiographical in the great tragedies. Undoubtedly Shakespeare
felt that there was an iron discipline in beholding a great tragedy.
To live it over in the soul tempered it, gave it firmness and resolution,
and it is not impossible that the sympathetic, high-strung
Shakespeare needed just such discipline. But we must not forget
the element of play. All art is, in a sense, a game with images
and feelings and human utterances. "In all this century-old
discussion about the subtlety of Hamlet's character critics have
forgotten that a piece of literature is, first of all, a festive sport
with clear pictures, finely organized emotions, and eloquent words
uttered in moments of deep feeling." The poet who remembers
this will use his work to drive from the earth something of its
gloom and melancholy. He will strengthen himself that he may
strengthen others.</p>

<p>I have tried to give an adequate synopsis of Collin's article
but, in addition to the difficulties of translating the language,
there are the difficulties, infinitely greater, of putting into definite
words all that the Norwegian hints at and suggests. It is not
high praise to say that Collin has written the most notable piece
of Shakespeare criticism in Norway; indeed, nothing better has
been written either in Norway or Denmark.</p>

<p>The study of Shakespeare in Norway was not, as the foregoing
shows, extensive or profound, but there were many Norwegian
scholars who had at least considerable information about things
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
Shakespearean. No great piece of research is to be recorded, but
the stimulating criticism of Caspari, Collin, Just Bing, and Bjørnson
is worth reading to this day.</p>

<p>The same comment may be made on two other
contributions&mdash;Wiesener's <i>Almindelig Indledning til
Shakespeare</i> (General Introduction
to Shakespeare), published as an introduction to his
school edition of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>,<a name = "tag2_24"
href = "#note2_24"><sup>II.24</sup></a> and Collin's <i>Indledning</i>
to his edition of the same play. Both are frankly compilations,
but both are admirably organized, admirably written, and full
of a personal enthusiasm which gives the old, sometimes hackneyed
facts a new interest.</p>

<p>Wiesener's edition was published in 1880 in Christiania. The
text is that of the Cambridge edition with a few necessary cuttings
to adapt it for school reading. His introduction covers
fifty-two closely printed pages and gives, within these limits, an
exceedingly detailed account of the English drama, the Elizabethan
stage, Shakespeare's life and work, and a careful study of
<i>The Merchant of Venice</i> itself. The editor does not pretend to
originality; he has simply tried to bring together well ascertained
facts and to present them in the simplest, clearest fashion possible.
But the <i>Indledning</i> is to-day, thirty-five years after it was
written, fully up to the standard of the best annotated school
editions in this country or in England. It is, of course, a little
dry and schematic; that could hardly be avoided in an attempt
to compress such a vast amount of information into such a small
compass, but, for the most part, the details are so clear and vivid
that their mass rather heightens than blurs the picture.</p>

<p>From the fact that nothing in this introduction is original,
it is hardly necessary to criticise it at length; all that may be
demanded is a short survey of the contents. The whole consists
of two great divisions, a general introduction to Shakespeare and
a special introduction to <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>. The first
division is, in turn, subdivided into seven heads:
1.&nbsp;<i>The Pre-Shakespearean Drama</i>. 2.&nbsp;<i>The Life of
Shakespeare</i>. 3.&nbsp;<i>Shakespeare's Works&mdash;Order and
Chronology</i>. 4.&nbsp;<i>Shakespeare as a Dramatist</i>.
5.&nbsp;<i>Shakespeare's Versification</i>. 6.&nbsp;<i>The Text of
Shakespeare</i>. 7.&nbsp;<i>The Theatres of Shakespeare's Time</i>.
This introduction fills thirty-nine
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
pages and presents an exceedingly useful compendium for
the student and the general reader. The short introduction to
the play itself discusses briefly the texts, the sources, the characters,
Shakespeare's relation to his material and, finally, the meaning
of the play. The last section is, however, a translation from Taine
and not Wiesener's at all.</p>

<p>The text itself is provided with elaborate notes of the usual
text-book sort. In addition to these there is, at the back, an
admirable series of notes on the language of Shakespeare. Wiesener
explains in simple, compact fashion some of the differences
between Elizabethan and modern English and traces these phenomena
back to their origins in Anglo-Saxon and Middle English.
Inadequate as they are, these linguistic notes cannot be too highly
praised for the conviction of which they bear evidence&mdash;that a
complete knowledge of Shakespeare without a knowledge of his
language is impossible. To the student of that day these notes
must have been a revelation.</p>

<p>The second text edition of a Shakespearean play in Norway
was Collin's <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>.<a name = "tag2_25"
href = "#note2_25"><sup>II.25</sup></a>
His introduction covers
much the same ground as Wiesener's, but he offers no sketch of
the Elizabethan drama, of Shakespeare's life, or of his development
as a dramatic artist. On the other hand, his critical analysis
of the play is fuller and, instead of a mere summary, he gives
an elaborate exposition of Shakespeare's versification.</p>

<p>Collin is a critic of rare insight. Accordingly, although he
says nothing new in his discussion of the purport and content of
the play, he makes the old story live anew. He <ins class = "correction"
title = "so in original: imagines?">images</ins> Shakespeare
in the midst of his materials&mdash;how he found them, how he
gave them life and being. The section on Shakespeare's language
is not so solid and scientific as Wiesener's, but his discussion of
Shakespeare's versification is both longer and more valuable than
Wiesener's fragmentary essay, and Shakespeare's relation to his
sources is treated much more suggestively.</p>

<p>He points out, first of all, that in Shakespeare's "classical"
plays the characters of high rank commonly use verse and those
of low rank, prose. This is, however, not a law. The real principle
of the interchange of prose and verse is in the emotions to
<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
be conveyed. Where these are tense, passionate, exalted, they
are communicated in verse; where they are ordinary, commonplace,
they are expressed in prose. This rule will hold both for
characters of high station and for the most humble. In Act I,
for example, Portia speaks in prose to her maid "obviously because
Shakespeare would lower the pitch and reduce the suspense.
In the following scene, the conversation between Shylock and
Bassanio begins in prose. But as soon as Antonio appears, Shylock's
emotions are roused to their highest pitch, and his speech
turns naturally to verse&mdash;even though he is alone and his speech
an aside. A storm of passions sets his mind and speech in rhythmic
motion. And from that point on, the conversations of Shylock,
Bassanio, and Antonio are in verse. In short, rhythmic speech
when there is a transition to strong, more dramatic feeling."</p>

<p>The use of prose or verse depends, then, on the kind and depth
of feeling rather than on the characters. "In Act II Launcelot
Gobbo and his father are the only ones who employ prose. All
the others speak in verse&mdash;even the servant who tells of Bassanio's
arrival. Not only that, but he speaks in splendid verse even
though he is merely announcing a messenger:"</p>

<div class = "verse3">
"Yet have I not seen</div>
<div class = "verse">
So likely an ambassador of love," etc.
</div>

<p>Again, in <i>Lear</i>, the servant who protests against Cornwall's
cruelty to Gloster, nameless though he is, speaks in noble and stately
lines:</p>

<div class = "verse3">
Hold your hand, my lord;</div>
<div class = "verse">
I've served you ever since I was a child;<br>
But better service have I never done you<br>
Than now to bid you hold.
</div>

<p>When the dramatic feeling warrants it, the humblest rise to the
highest poetry. The renaissance was an age of deeper, mightier
feelings than our own, and this intense life speaks in verse, for
only thus can it adequately express itself.</p>

<p>All this is romantic enough. But it is to be doubted if the
men of the renaissance were so different from us that they felt
an instinctive need of bursting into song. The causes of the
efflorescence of Elizabethan dramatic poetry are not, I think,
to be sought in such subtleties as these.</p>

<p>Collin further insists that the only way to understand Shakespeare's
versification is to understand his situations and his characters.
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
Rules avail little. If we do not <i>feel</i> the meaning of the
music, we shall never understand the meaning of the verse. Shakespeare's
variations from the normal blank verse are to be interpreted
from this point of view. Hence what the metricists call
"irregularities" are not irregularities at all. Collin examines
the more important of these irregularities and tries to account
for them.</p>

<p>1. Short broken lines as in I,&nbsp;1-5: <i>I am to learn.</i> Antonio
completes this line by a shrug of the shoulders or a gesture. "It
would be remarkable," concludes Collin, "if there were no
interruptions or pauses even though the characters speak in verse."
Another example of this breaking of the line for dramatic purposes is
found in <ins class = "correction" title = "original reads 'I-3-1.3'">I,
3-123</ins> where Shylock suddenly stops after "say this"
as if to draw breath and arrange his features. <ins class = "correction"
title = "so in original">(Sic!)</ins></p>

<p>2. A verse may be abnormally long and contain six feet. This
is frequently accidental, but in <i>M of V</i> it is used at least once
deliberately&mdash;in the oracular inscriptions on the caskets:</p>

<div class = "verse">
"Who chooseth me shall gain what men desire."<br>
"Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves."<br>
"Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he has."
</div>

<p>Collin explains that putting these formulas into Alexandrines
gives them a stiffness and formality appropriate to their purpose.</p>

<p>3. Frequently one or two light syllables are added to the close
of the verse:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster.
</div>

<p>or</p>

<div class = "verse">
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice.
</div>

<p>Again, in III,&nbsp;2-214 we have two unstressed syllables:</p>

<div class = "verse">
But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel?
</div>

<p>"Shakespeare uses this unaccented gliding ending more in his
later works to give an easier more unconstrained movement."</p>

<p>4. <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'Occassionally'">Occasionally</ins>
a syllable is lacking, and the foot seems to halt
as in V,&nbsp;1-17:</p>

<div class = "verse">
As far as Belmont. In such a night, etc.
</div>

<p>Here a syllable is lacking in the third foot. But artistically this
is no defect. We cannot ask that Jessica and Lorenzo always have
the right word at hand. The defective line simply means a pause
and, therefore, instead of being a blemish, is exactly right.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">89</span></p>

<p>5. On the other hand, there is often an extra light syllable
before the caesura. (I,&nbsp;1-48):</p>

<div class = "verse">
Because you are not merry; and 'twere as easy, etc.
</div>

<p>This extra syllable before the pause gives the effect of a slight
retardation. It was another device to make the verse easy and
unconstrained.</p>

<p>6. Though the prevailing verse is iambic pentameter, we rarely
find more than three or four real accents. The iambic movement
is constantly broken and compelled to fight its way through. This
gives an added delight, since the ear, attuned to the iambic beat,
readily recognizes it when it recurs. The presence of a trochee
is no blemish, but a relief:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Vailing her high tops higher than her ribs. <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'I-1-28'">(I,&nbsp;1-28)</ins>
</div>

<p>This inverted stress occurs frequently in Norwegian poetry.
Wergeland was a master of it and used it with great effect, for
instance, in his poem to Ludvig Daa beginning:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Med døden i mit hjerte,<br>
og smilet om min mund,&mdash;
</div>

<p>All this gives to Shakespeare's verse a marvellous flexibility
and power. Nor are these devices all that the poet had at his
disposal. We frequently find three syllables to the foot, giving
the line a certain fluidity which a translator only rarely can reproduce.
Finally, a further difficulty in translating Shakespeare
lies in the richness of the English language in words of one syllable.
What literature can rival the grace and smoothness of:</p>

<div class = "verse">
In sooth I know not why I am so sad.
</div>

<p>Ten monosyllables in succession! It is enough to drive a translator
to despair. Or take:</p>

<div class = "verse">
To be or not to be, that is the question.
</div>

<p>To summarize, no other language can rival English in dramatic
dialogue in verse, and this is notably true of Shakespeare's English,
where the word order is frequently simpler and more elastic
than it is in modern English.</p>

<p>Two reviews of Collin quickly appeared in a pedagogical
magazine, <i>Den Höiere Skole</i>. The first of them,<a name = "tag2_26"
href = "#note2_26"><sup>II.26</sup></a> by Ivar Alnæs,
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
is a brief, rather perfunctory review. He points out that <i>The
Merchant of Venice</i> is especially adapted to reading in the gymnasium,
for it is unified in structure, the characters are clearly
presented, the language is not difficult, and the picture is worth
while historically. Collin has, therefore, done a great service in
making the play available for teaching purposes. Alnæs warmly
praises the introduction; it is clear, full, interesting, and marked
throughout by a tone of genuine appreciation. But right here
lies its weakness. It is not always easy to distinguish ascertained
facts from Collin's imaginative combinations. Every page,
however, gives evidence of the editor's endeavor to give to the
student fresh, stimulating impressions, and new, revealing points
of view. This is a great merit and throws a cloak over many
eccentricities of language.</p>

<p>But Collin was not to escape so easily. In the same volume Dr. August
Western<a name = "tag2_27" href = "#note2_27"><sup>II.27</sup></a>
wrote a severe criticism of Collin's treatment of Shakespeare's
versification.</p>

<p>He agrees, as a matter of course, that Shakespeare is a master
of versification, but he does not believe that Collin has proved
it. That blank verse is the natural speech of the chief characters
or of the minor characters under emotional stress, that prose is
<i>usually</i> used by minor characters or by important characters under
no emotional strain is, in Dr. Western's opinion, all wrong. Nor
is prose per se more restful than poetry. And is not Shylock
more emotional in his scene (I,&nbsp;3) than any of the characters in
the casket scene immediately following (II,&nbsp;1)? According to
Collin, then, I,&nbsp;3 should be in verse and II,&nbsp;1 in prose! Equally
absurd is the theory that Shakespeare's characters speak in verse
because their natures demand it. Does Shylock go contrary to
nature in III,&nbsp;1? There is no psychological reason for Verse in
Shakespeare. He wrote as he did because convention prescribed
it. The same is true of Goethe and Schiller, of Bjørnson and
Ibsen in their earlier plays. Shakespeare's lapses into prose
are, moreover, easy to explain. There must always be something
to amuse the gallery. Act III,&nbsp;1 must be so understood, for though
Shakespeare was undoubtedly moved, the effect of the scene was
comic. The same is true of the dialogue between Portia and Nerissa
in Act I, and of all the scenes in which Launcelot Gobbo appears.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">91</span>
Western admits, however, that much of the prose in Shakespeare
cannot be so explained; for example, the opening scenes in
<i>Lear</i> and <i>The Tempest</i>. And this brings up another point,
i.e., Collin's supposition that Shakespeare's texts as we have them
are exactly as he wrote them. When the line halts, Collin simply
finds proof of the poet's fine ear! The truth probably is that
Shakespeare had a good ear and that he always wrote good lines,
but that he took no pains to see that these lines were correctly
printed. Take, for example, such a line as:</p>

<div class = "verse">
As far as Belmont.</div>
<div class = "verse4">
In such a night
</div>

<p>This would, if written by anyone else, always be considered bad,
and Dr. Western does not believe that Collin's theory of the pauses
will hold. The pause plays no part in verse. A line consists of
a fixed number of <i>heard</i> syllables. Collin would say that a line
like I,&nbsp;1-73:</p>

<div class = "verse">
I will not fail you,
</div>

<p>is filled out with a bow and a swinging of the hat. Then why are
the lines just before it, in which Salarino and Salario take leave
of each other, not defective? Indeed, how can we be sure that
much of what passes for "Shakespeare's versification" is not based
on printers' errors? In the folio of 1623 there are long passages
printed in prose which, after closer study, we must believe were
written in verse&mdash;the opening of <i>Lear</i> and <i>The Tempest</i>.
Often,
too, it is plain that the beginnings and endings of lines have been
run together. Take the passage:</p>

<div class = "speaker">Sal:</div>
<div class = "verse">
Why, then you are in love.</div>
<div class = "speaker">Ant:</div>
<div class = "verse4">
Fie, fie!</div>
<div class = "speaker">Sal:</div>
<div class = "verse">
Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad&mdash;</div>

<p>The first line is one foot short, the second one foot too long. This
Collin would call a stroke of genius; each <i>fie</i> is a complete foot,
and the line is complete! But what if the line were printed thus:</p>

<div class = "speaker">Sal:</div>
<div class = "verse">
Why, then you are in love.</div>
<div class = "speaker">Ant:</div>
<div class = "verse4">
Fie, fie!</div>
<div class = "speaker">Sal:</div>
<div class = "verse5">
Not in</div>
<div class = "verse">
Love neither? Then let us say you are sad.</div>

<p>or possibly:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Love neither? Then let's say that you are sad.</div>

<p><span class = "pagenum">92</span>
Another possible printer's error is found in I,&nbsp;3-116:</p>

<div class = "verse">
With bated breath and whispering humbleness<br>
Say this;<br>
Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last.</div>

<p>Are we here to imagine a pause of four feet? And what are we to
do with the first folio which has</p>

<div class = "verse">
Say this; Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last.
</div>

<p>all in one line? Perhaps some printer chose between the two.
At any rate, Collin's theory will not hold. In the schools, of course,
one cannot be a text critic but, on the other hand, one must not
praise in Shakespeare what may be the tricks of the printer's
devil. The text is not always faultless.</p>

<p>Finally, Dr. Western objects to the statement that the difficulty
in translating Shakespeare lies in the great number of
monosyllables and gives</p>

<div class = "verse">
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad
</div>

<p>as proof. Ten monosyllables in one line! But this is not impossible
in Norwegian:</p>

<div class = "verse">
For sand, jeg ved ei, hvi jeg er saa trist&mdash;
</div>

<p>It is not easy to translate Shakespeare, but the difficulty goes
deeper than his richness in words of one syllable.</p>

<p>With the greater part of Dr. Western's article everyone will
agree. It is doubtful if any case could be made out for the division
of prose and verse based on psychology. Shakespeare probably
wrote his plays in verse for the same reason that Goethe and
Schiller and Oehlenschläger did. It was the fashion. And how
difficult it is to break with fashion or with old tradition, the
history of Ibsen's transition from poetry to prose shows. It is
equally certain that in Collin's <i>Introduction</i> it is difficult to
distinguish ascertained facts from brilliant speculation. But it is
not easy to agree with Dr. Western that Collin's explanation of
the "pause" is a tissue of fancy.</p>

<p>In the first place, no one denies that the printers have at times
played havoc with Shakespeare's text. Van Dam and Stoffel, to
whose book Western refers and whose suggestions are directly
responsible for this article, have shown this clearly enough. But
when Dr. Western argues that because printers have corrupted
the text in some places, they must be held accountable for every
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
defective short line, we answer, it does not follow. In the second
place, why should not a pause play a part in prosody as well as
in music? Recall Tennyson's verse:</p>

<div class = "verse3">
Break, break, break,</div>
<div class = "verse3">
On thy cold, grey stones, o sea!
</div>

<p>where no one feels that the first line is defective. Of course the
answer is that in Tennyson no accented syllable is lacking. But it
is difficult to understand what difference this makes. When the
reader has finished pronouncing <i>Belmont</i> there <i>must</i> be a
moment's hesitation before Lorenzo breaks in with:</p>

<div class = "verse">
In such a night
</div>

<p>and this pause may have metrical value. The only judge of verse,
after all, is the hearer, and, in my opinion, Collin is right when he
points out the value of the slight metrical pause between the bits
of repartee. Whether Shakespeare counted the syllables beforehand
or not, is another matter. In the third place, Collin did not
quote in support of his theory the preposterous lines which Dr.
Western uses against him. Collin does quote I,&nbsp;1-5:</p>

<div class = "verse">
I am to learn.
</div>

<p>and I,&nbsp;1-73:</p>

<div class = "verse">
I will not fail you
</div>

<p>is a close parallel, but Collin probably would not insist that his
theory accounts for every case. As to Dr. Western's other example
of good meter spoiled by corrupt texts, Collin would, no doubt,
admit the possibility of the proposed emendations. It would
not alter his contention that a pause in the line, like a pause in
music, is not necessarily void, but may be very significant indeed.</p>

<p>The array of Shakespearean critics in Norway, as we said at
the beginning, is not imposing. Nor are their contributions
important. But they show, at least, a sound acquaintance with
Shakespeare and Shakespeareana, and some of them, like the
articles of Just Bing, Brettville Jensen, Christen Collin, and
August Western, are interesting and illuminating. Bjørnson's
article in <i>Aftenbladet</i> is not merely suggestive as Shakespearean
criticism, but it throws valuable light on Bjørnson himself
and his literary development. When we come to the dramatic
criticism of Shakespeare's plays, we shall find renewed evidence of
a wide and intelligent knowledge of Shakespeare in Norway.</p>

<a name = "note2_23" href = "#tag2_23">II.23.</a>** This article is
reprinted in <i>Det Geniale Menneske</i> above referred to. It forms
the second of a group of essays in which Collin analyzes the work of
Shakespeare as the finest example of the true contribution of genius
to the progress and culture of the race. Preceding the study of
<i>Hamlet</i> is a chapter called <i>The <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'Shakespeareen'">Shakespearean</ins>
Controversy</i>, and following it is a study of Shakespeare the Man. This
is in three parts, the first of which is a reprint of an article in
<i>Samtiden</i> (1901).
</div>
<div class = "footnote">
In <i>Det Geniale Menneske</i> Collin defines
civilization as that higher state
which the human race has attained by means of "psychic
organs"&mdash;superior to the physical organs. The psychic organs have
been created by the human intellect and they are controlled by the
intellect. Had man been dependent
upon the physical organs solely, he would have remained an animal. His
psychic organs have enabled him to create instruments, tangible, such as
tools and machines; intangible, such as works of art. These are psychic
organs and with their aid man has become a civilized being.
</div>
<div class = "footnote">
The psychic organs are the creation of the man of genius. To create such
organs is his function. The characteristics,
then, of the genius are an immense
capacity for sympathy and an immense surplus of power; sympathy, that he
may know the needs of mankind; power, that he may fashion those great
organs of life by which the race may live and grow.
</div>
<div class = "footnote">
In the various chapters of his book, Collin analyzes
in an illuminating way the life and work of Wergeland, Ibsen, and
Bjørnson as typical men of genius
whose expansive sympathy gave them insight and understanding and whose
indefatigable energy wrought in the light of their insight mighty psychic
organs of cultural progress.
</div>
<div class = "footnote">
He comes then to Shakespeare as the genius par excellence. The chapter
on the <i>Shakespearean Controversy</i> gives first a survey of the
development of modern scientific literary criticism from
Herder to Taine and Saint Beuve. He goes on to detail the
application of this method to the plays and sonnets
of Shakespeare. Furnivall, Spalding, and Brandes have attempted to trace
the genesis and the chronology of the plays. They would have us believe
that the series of tragedies&mdash;<i>Hamlet</i>,
<i>Macbeth</i>, <i>Othello</i>,
<i>Lear</i>, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>,
<i>Coriolanus</i>, and <i>Timon</i> are the records of an increasing
bitterness and pessimism. Brandes and Frank Harris, following Thomas
Tyler have, on the basis of the sonnets, constructed a fascinating, but
quite fantastic romance.
</div>
<div class = "footnote">
Vagaries such as these have caused some critics, such as Sidney Lee and
<ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'Bierfreund to, declare'">Bierfreund, to
declare</ins> that it is impossible on the basis of the plays to
penetrate to Shakespeare the man. His work is too purely objective.
Collin is not willing to admit this. He maintains that the scientific
biographical method of criticism is fundamentally sound.
But it must be rationally applied. The
sequence which Brandes has set up is quite impossible. Goswin Kønig, in
1888, applying the metrical tests, fixed the order as follows:
<i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, <i>Measure for Measure</i>,
<i>Othello</i>, <i>Timon</i>, and <i>Lear</i>, and, in another
group, <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>,
and <i>Coriolanus</i>. These
results are confirmed by Bradley in his <i>Shakespearean Tragedy</i>.
</div>
<div class = "footnote">
Collin accepts this chronology. A careful study of the plays in this
order shows a striking community of ethical purpose between the plays of
each group. In the plays of the first group, the poet assails with all
his mighty wrath what to him seems the basest of all wickedness,
treachery. It is characteristic
of these plays that none of the villains attains the dignity of a great
tragic hero. They are without a virtue to redeem their faults.
Shakespeare's conception of the good and evil in these plays approaches
a medieval dualism. In the plays of the second group the case is altered.
There is no longer a crude dualism in the interpretation of life.
Shakespeare has entered into the soul of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth,
of Antony and Cleopatra, of Coriolanus,
and he has found underneath all that is weak and sinful and diseased, a
certain nobility and grandeur. He can feel with the regicides in Macbeth;
he no longer exposes and scourges; he understands and sympathizes. The
clouds of gloom and wrath have cleared away, and Shakespeare has achieved
a serenity and a fine poise.
</div>
<div class = "footnote">
It follows, then, that the theory of a growing pessimism is untenable.
We must seek a new line of evolution.

<h1>CHAPTER III</h1>

<h2>Performances of Shakespeare's Plays in Norway</h2>

<p align = "center"><i>Christiania</i></p>

<p>The first public theater in Christiania was opened by the Swedish
actor, Johan Peter Strömberg, on January 30, 1827, but no
Shakespeare production was put on during his short and troubled
administration. Not quite two years later this strictly private
undertaking became a semi-public one under the immediate direction
of J.K. Böcher, and at the close of the season 1829-30, Böcher
gave by way of epilogue to the year, two performances including
scenes from Holberg's <i>Melampe</i>, Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i>, and
Oehlenschläger's <i>Aladdin</i>. The Danish actor Berg played Hamlet,
but we have no further details of the performance. We may be
sure, however, that of the two translations available, Boye's and
Foersom's, the latter was used. <i>Hamlet</i>, or a part of it, was thus
given for the first time in Norway nearly seventeen years after
Foersom himself had brought it upon the stage in Denmark.<a name =
"tag3_1" href = "#note3_1"><sup>III.1</sup></a></p>

<p>More than fourteen years were to elapse before the theater
took up Shakespeare in earnest. On July 28, 1844, the first complete
Shakespearean play was given. This was <i>Macbeth</i> in Foersom's
version of Schiller's "bearbeitung," which we shall take
up in our studies of Shakespeare in
Denmark.<a name = "tag3_2" href = "#note3_2"><sup>III.2</sup></a>
No reviews of
it are to be found in the newspapers of the time, not even an
announcement. This, however, does not prove that the event was
unnoticed, for the press of that day was a naive one. Extensive
reviews were unknown; the most that the public expected was a
notice.</p>

<p>We are equally ignorant of the fate of <i>Othello</i>, performed the
next season, being given for the first time on January 3, 1845.
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
Wulff's Danish translation was used. Blanc says in his
<i>Historie</i><a name = "tag3_3" href = "#note3_3"><sup>III.3</sup></a>
that Desdemona and Iago were highly praised, but that the play
as a whole was greatly beyond the powers of the theater.</p>

<p>Nearly eight years later, November 11, 1852, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
in Foersom's translation received its Norwegian premiere. The
acting version used was that made for the Royal Theater in Copenhagen
by A.E. Boye in 1828.<a name = "tag3_4"
href = "#note3_4"><sup>III.4</sup></a>
<i>Christiania Posten</i><a name = "tag3_5"
href = "#note3_5"><sup>III.5</sup></a>
reports a packed house and a tremendous enthusiasm. Romeo (by Wiehe)
and Juliet (by Jomfru Svendsen) revealed careful study and complete
understanding. The reviewer in <i>Morgenbladet</i><a name = "tag3_6"
href = "#note3_6"><sup>III.6</sup></a> begins with
the little essay on Shakespeare so common at the time; "Everyone
knows with what colors the immortal Shakespeare depicts human passions.
In <i>Othello</i>, jealousy; in <i>Hamlet</i>, despair; in
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, love, are sung in tones which penetrate to the
depths of the soul. Against the background of bitter feud, the
love of Romeo and Juliet stands out victorious and beneficent.
Even if we cannot comprehend this passion, we can, at least, feel
the ennobling power of the story." Both of the leading parts are
warmly praised. Of Wiehe the reviewer says: "Der var et Liv
af Varme hos ham i fuldt Maal, og den grændseløse Fortvivlelse
blev gjengivet med en næsten forfærdelig Troskab."</p>

<p>The same season (Dec. 11, 1852) the theater also presented
<i>As You Like It</i> in the Danish version by Sille Beyer. The
performance of two Shakespearean plays within a year may rightly be
called an ambitious undertaking for a small theatre without a
cent of subsidy. <i>Christiania Posten</i> says: "It is a real kindness
to the public to make it acquainted with these old masterpieces.
One feels refreshed, as though coming out of a bath, after a plunge
into their boundless, pure poetry. The marvellous thing about this comedy
(<i>As You Like It</i>) is its wonderful, spontaneous freshness,
and its freedom from all sentimentality and emotional nonsense."
The acting, says the critic, was admirable, but its high
quality must, in a measure, be attributed to the sympathy and
enthusiasm of the audience. Wiehe is praised for his interpretation
of Orlando and Jomfru Svendsen for her Rosalind.<a name = "tag3_7"
href = "#note3_7"><sup>III.7</sup></a> Apparently
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
none of the reviewers noticed that Sille Beyer had turned Shakespeare
upside down. Her version was given for the last time on
Sept. 25, 1878, and in this connection an interesting discussion
sprang up in the press.</p>

<p>The play was presented by student actors, and the performance
was therefore less finished than it would have been under
other circumstances. <i>Aftenposten</i> was doubtless right when it
criticised the director for entrusting so great a play to unpractised
hands, assuming that Shakespeare should be played at all. "For
our part, we do not believe the time far distant when Shakespeare
will cease to be a regular part of the repertoire."<a name = "tag3_8"
href = "#note3_8"><sup>III.8</sup></a> To this statement
a contributor in <i>Aftenposten</i> for Sept. 28 objected. He admits
that Shakespeare wrote his plays for a stage different from our
own, that the ease with which Elizabethan scenery was shifted
gave his plays a form that makes them difficult to play today.
Too often at a modern presentation we feel that we are seeing a
succession of scenes rather than unified, organic drama. But,
after all, the main thing is the substance&mdash;"the weighty content,
and this will most certainly secure for them for a long time to
come a place in the repertoire of the theater of the Germanic
world. So long as we admit that in the delineation of character,
in the presentation of noble figures, and in the mastery of dialogue,
Shakespeare is unexcelled, so long we must admit that
Shakespeare has a place on the modern stage."</p>

<p>Where did <i>Aftenposten</i>'s reviewer get the idea that
Shakespeare's plays are not adapted to the modern stage? Was it
from Charles Lamb? At any rate, it is certain that he anticipated
a movement that has led to many devices both in the English-speaking
countries and in Germany to reproduce the stage
conditions under which Shakespeare's plays were performed
during his own life.</p>

<p>Of the next Shakespearean piece to be performed in Christiania,
<i>All's Well That Ends Well</i>, there is but the briefest mention
in the newspapers. We know that it was given in the curiously
perverted arrangement by Sille Beyer and was presented twelve
times from January 15, 1854 to May 23, 1869. On that day a
new version based on Lembcke's translation was used, and in this
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
form the play was given eight times the following seasons. Since
January 24, 1882, it has not been performed in Norway.<a name = "tag3_9"
href = "#note3_9"><sup>III.9</sup></a></p>

<p>At the beginning of the next season, October 29, 1854, <i>Much
Ado About Nothing</i> was introduced to Kristiania theater-goers
under the title <i>Blind Alarm</i>. The translation was by Carl Borgaard,
director of the theater. But here, too, contemporary
documents leave us in the dark. There is merely a brief announcement
in the newspapers. Blanc informs us that Jomfru Svendsen
played Hero, and Wiehe,
Benedict.<a name = "tag3_10" href = "#note3_10"><sup>III.10</sup></a></p>

<p>After <i>Blind Alarm</i> Shakespeare disappears from the repertoire
for nearly four years. A version of <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>
under the title <i>Hun Maa Tæmmes</i> was given on March 28, 1858,
but with no great success. Most of the papers ignored it.
<i>Aftenbladet</i> merely announced that it had been
given.<a name = "tag3_11" href = "#note3_11"><sup>III.11</sup></a></p>

<p><i>Viola</i>, Sille Beyer's adaptation of <i>Twelfth Night</i> was
presented at Christiania Theater on November 20, 1860, the eighth of
Shakespeare's plays to be presented in Norway, and again not merely
in a Danish text but in a version made for the Copenhagen Theater.</p>

<p>Neither the critics nor the public were exacting. The press
hailed <i>Viola</i> as a tremendous relief from the frothy stuff with
which theater-goers had been sickened for a season or two. "The
theater finally justified its existence," says
<i>Morgenbladet</i>,<a name = "tag3_12"
href = "#note3_12"><sup>III.12</sup></a>
"by a performance of one of Shakespeare's plays. Viola was beautifully
done." The writer then explains in conventional fashion
the meaning of the English title and goes on&mdash;"But since the
celebration of <i>Twelfth Night</i> could interest only the English, the
Germans have "bearbeidet" the play and centered the interest
around Viola. We have adopted this version." He approves
of Sille Beyer's cutting, though he admits that much is lost of the
breadth and overwhelming romantic fulness that mark the original.
But this he thinks is compensated for by greater intelligibility
and the resulting dramatic effect. "Men hvad Stykket ved
saadan Forandring, Beklippelse, og Udeladelse <ins class = "correction"

<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
for vort Publikum og denne mere afrundede sceniske Virkning,
Stykket ved Bearbeidelsen har faaet." As the piece is arranged
<ins class = "correction" title = "original reads 'now Viola, and'">now,
Viola and</ins> her brother are not on the stage at the
same time until Act V. Both rôles may therefore be played by
Jomfru Svendsen. The critic is captivated by her acting of the
double rôle, and Jørgensen's Malvolio and Johannes Brun's Sir
Andrew Aguecheek share with her the glory of a thoroughly successful
performance.</p>

<p>Sille Beyer's <i>Viola</i> was given twelve times. From the thirteenth
performance, January 21, 1890, <i>Twelfth Night</i> was given
in a new form based on Lembcke's translation.</p>

<p>A thorough search through the newspaper files fails to reveal
even a slight notice of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> (Kjøbmanden i
Venedig) played for the first time on Sept. 17, 1861. Rahbek's
translation was used, and this continued to be the standard until
1874, when, beginning with the eighth performance, it was replaced
by Lembcke's.</p>

<p>We come, then, to <i>A&nbsp;Midsummer Night's Dream</i>
(Skjærsommernatsdrømmen) played in Oehlenschläger's translation under
Bjørnson's direction on April 17, 1865. The play was given ten
times from that date till May 27, 1866. In spite of this unusual
run it appears to have been only moderately successful, and when
Bjørnson dropped it in the spring of 1866, it was to disappear from
the repertoire for thirty-seven years. On January 15, 1903, it
was revived by Bjørnson's son, Bjørn Bjørnson. This time,
however, it was called <i>Midsommernatsdrömmen</i>, and the acting
version was based on Lembcke's translation. In this new shape
it has been played twenty-seven times up to January, 1913.</p>

<p>The interesting polemic which Bjørnson's production occasioned
has already been discussed at some length. This may <ins class =
"correction" title =
"original reads 'be according added, however: A play which, to'">be
added, however: A play which, according to</ins> the poet's confession,
influenced his life as this one did, has played an important part
in Norwegian literature. The influence may be intangible. It is
none the less real.</p>

<p>More popular than any of the plays which had thus far been presented
in Norway was <i>A&nbsp;Winter's Tale</i>, performed at Christiania
Theater for the first time on May 4, 1866. The version
used had, however, but a faint resemblance to the original. It was
a Danish revision of Dingelstedt's <i>Ein Wintermärchen</i>. I shall
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
discuss this Holst-Dingelstedt text in another place. At this
point it is enough to say that Shakespeare is highly diluted. It
seems, nevertheless, to have been successful, for between the date
of its premiere and March 21, 1893, when it was given for the last
time, it received fifty-seven performances, easily breaking all
records for Shakespearean plays at the old theater. And at the
new National Theater, where it has never been given, no Shakespearean
play, with the exception of <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> has
approached its record.</p>

<p><i>Aftenbladet</i><a name = "tag3_13"
href = "#note3_13"><sup>III.13</sup></a>
in its preliminary review said: "Although this is
not one of Shakespeare's greatest plays, it is well worth putting
on, especially in the form which Dingelstedt has given to it. It
was received with the greatest enthusiasm." But <i>Aftenbladet's</i>
promised critical review never appeared.</p>

<p>More interesting and more important than most of the performances
which we have thus far considered is that of <i>Henry IV</i>
in 1867, while Bjørnson was still director. To his desire to give
Johannes Brun an opportunity for the display of his genius in the
greatest of comic rôles we owe this version of the play. Bjørnson
obviously could not give both parts, and he chose to combine
cuttings from the two into a single play with Falstaff as the central
figure. The translation used was Lembcke's and the text was only
slightly norvagicized.</p>

<p>Bjørnson's original prompt book is not now available. In
1910, however, H. Wiers Jensen, a playwright associated with the
National Theater, shortened and slightly adapted the version for
a revival of the play, which had not been seen in Kristiania since
February 8, 1885. We may assume that in all essentials the
prompt book of 1910 reproduces that of 1867.</p>

<p>In this <i>Kong Henrik IV</i> the action opens with I Henry IV, II-4,
and Act I consists of this scene freely cut and equally freely handled
in the distribution of speeches. The opening of the scene, for
example, is cut away entirely and replaced by a brief account of
the robbery put naively into the mouth of Poins. The opening of
Act II is entirely new. Since all the historical scenes of Act I
of the original have been omitted, it becomes necessary to give the
audience some notion of the background. This is done in a few
lines in which the King tells of the revolt of the nobles and of his
<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
own difficult situation. Then follows the king's speech from
Part I, Act III, Sc. 2:</p>

<div class = "verse">
Lords, give us leave; the prince of Wales and I<br>
must have some conference...
</div>

<p>and what follows is the remainder of the scene with many cuttings.
Sir Walter Blunt does not appear. His rôle is taken by Warwick.</p>

<p>Act II, Sc. 2 of Bjørnson's text follows Part I, Act III, Sc. 3
closely.</p>

<p>Act III, Sc. 1 corresponds with Part I, Act III, Sc. 1 to the
point where Lady Mortimer and Lady Percy enter. This episode
is cut and the scene resumes with the entrance of the messenger
in Part I, Act IV, Sc. 1, line 14. This scene is then followed in
outline to the end.</p>

<p>Act III, Sc. 2 begins with Part I, Act IV, Sc. 3 from the entrance
of Falstaff, and follows it to the end of the scene. To this is
added most of Scene 4, but there is little left of the original action.
Only the Falstaff episodes are retained intact.</p>

<p>The last act (IV) is a wonderful composite. Scene 1 corresponds
closely to Part II, Act III, Sc. 4, but it is, as usual, severely
cut. Scene 2 reverts back to Part II, Act III, Sc. 2 and is based on
this scene to line 246, after which it is free handling of Part II,
Act V, Sc. 3. Scene 3 is based on Part II, Act V, Sc. 5.</p>

<p>A careful reading of Bjørnson's text with the above as a guide
will show that this collection of episodes, chaotic as it seems,
makes no ineffective play. With a genius&mdash;and a genius Johannes
Brun was&mdash;as Falstaff, one can imagine that the piece went
brilliantly. The press received it favorably, though the reviewers
were much too critical to allow Bjørnson's mangling of the text
to go unrebuked.</p>

<p><i>Aftenbladet</i> has a careful review.<a name = "tag3_14"
href = "#note3_14"><sup>III.14</sup></a>
The writer admits that
in our day it requires courage and labor to put on one of Shakespeare's
historical plays, for they were written for a stage radically
different from ours. In the Elizabethan times the immense scale
of these "histories" presented no difficulties. On a modern stage
the mere bulk makes a faithful rendition impossible. And the
moment one starts tampering with Shakespeare, trouble begins.
No two adapters will agree as to what or how to cut. Moreover,
<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
it may well be questioned whether any such cutting as that made
for the theater here would be tolerated in any other country with
a higher and older Shakespeare "Kultur." The attempt to fuse
the two parts of <i>Henry IV</i> would be impossible in a country with
higher standards. "Our theater can, however, venture undisturbed
to combine these two comprehensive series of scenes into
one which shall not require more time than each one of them
singly&mdash;a venture, to be sure, which is not wholly without precedent
in foreign countries. It is clear that the result cannot give
an adequate notion of Shakespeare's 'histories' in all their richness
of content, but it does, perhaps, give to the theater a series of
worth-while problems to work out, the importance of which
should not be underestimated. The attempt, too, has made our
theater-goers familiar with Shakespeare's greatest comic character,
apparently to their immense delight. Added to all this is the
fact that the acting was uniformly excellent."</p>

<p>But by what right is the play called Henry IV? Practically
nothing is left of the historical setting, and the spectator is at a
loss to know just what the whole thing is about. Certainly the
whole emphasis is shifted, for the king, instead of being an important
character is overshadowed by Prince Hal. The Falstaff
scenes, on the other hand, are left almost in their original fulness,
and thus constitute a much more important part of the play than
they do in the original. The article closes with a glowing tribute
to Johannes Brun as Falstaff.</p>

<p><i>Morgenbladet</i><a name = "tag3_15"
href = "#note3_15"><sup>III.15</sup></a>
goes into greater detail. The reviewer seems
to think that Shakespeare had some deep purpose in dividing the
material into two parts&mdash;he wished to have room to develop the
character of Prince Henry. "Accordingly, in the first part he
gives us the early stages of Prince Hal's growth, beginning with
the Prince of Wales as a sort of superior rake and tracing the
development of his better qualities. In Part II we see the complete
assertion of his spiritual and intellectual powers." The
writer overlooks the fact that what Shakespeare was writing first
of all&mdash;or rather, what he was
revising&mdash;was a chronicle. If he
required more than five acts to give the history of Henry IV he
could use ten and call it two plays. If, in so doing, he gave
admirable characterization, it was something inherent in his own
genius, not in the materials with which he was working.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">102</span>
The history, says the reviewer, and the Falstaff scenes are the
background for the study of the Prince, each one serving a distinct
purpose. But here the history has been made meaningless and
the Falstaff episodes have been put in the foreground. He points
out that balance, proportion, and perspective are all lost by this.
Yet, granting that such revolutionizing of a masterpiece is ever
allowable, it must be admitted that Bjørnson has done it with
considerable skill. Bjørnson's purpose is clear enough. He knew
that Johannes Brun as Falstaff would score a triumph, and this
success for his theater he was determined to secure. The same
motive was back of the version which Stjernstrøm put on in Stockholm,
and there can be little doubt that his success suggested the
idea to Bjørnson. The nature of the cutting reveals the purpose
at every step. For instance, the scene in which the Gadskill
robbery is made clear, is cut entirely. We thus lose the first
glimpse of the sterner and manlier side of the royal reveller. In
fact, if Bjørnson had been frank he would have called his play
<i>Falstaff&mdash;based on certain scenes from Shakespeare's Henry IV,
Parts I and II</i>.</p>

<p>Yet, though much has been lost, much of what remains is
excellent. Brun's Falstaff almost reconciles us to the sacrifice.
Long may he live and delight us with it! It is one of his most
superb creations. The cast as a whole is warmly praised. It is
interesting to note that at the close of the review the critic suggests
that the text be revised with Hagberg's Swedish translation
at hand, for Lembcke's Danish contains many words unusual
or even unfamiliar in Norwegian.</p>

<p><i>Henry IV</i> remained popular in Norway, although from February
8, 1885 to February 10, 1910 it was not given in Kristiania.
When, in 1910, it was revived with Løvaas as Falstaff, the reception
given it by the press was about what it had been a quarter of a
century before. <i>Aftenposten</i>'s<a name = "tag3_16"
href = "#note3_16"><sup>III.16</sup></a>
comment is characteristic: "The
play is turned upside down. The comic sub-plot with Falstaff as
central figure is brought forward to the exclusion of all the rest.
More than this, what is retained is shamelessly altered." Much
more scathing is a short review by Christian Elster in the magazine
<i>Kringsjaa</i>.<a name = "tag3_17"
href = "#note3_17"><sup>III.17</sup></a>
The play, he declares, has obviously been given
<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
to help out the box office by speculating in the popularity of Falstaff.
"There is no unity, no coherence, no consistency in the delineation of
characters, and even from the comic scenes the spirit has
fled."<a href = "#note3_17"><ins class = "correction" title =
"duplicate footnote reference in original"><sup>III.17</sup></ins></a></p>

<p>To all this it may be replied that the public was right when it
accepted Falstaff for what he was regardless of the violence done
to the original. The Norwegian public cared little about the
wars, little even about the king and the prince; but people will
tell one today of those glorious evenings when they sat in the
theater and revelled in Johannes Brun as the big, elephantine
knight.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1813, Foersom himself brought out <i>Hamlet</i>
on the Danish stage. Nearly sixty years were to pass before this
play was put on in Norway, March 4, 1870.</p>

<p>The press was not lavish in its praise.
<i>Dagbladet</i><a name = "tag3_18"
href = "#note3_18"><sup>III.18</sup></a> remarks
that though the performance was not what it ought to have been,
the audience followed it from first to last with undivided attention.
<i>Aftenbladet</i><a name = "tag3_19"
href = "#note3_19"><sup>III.19</sup></a>
has a long and interesting review. Most of it is
given over to a criticism of Isaachson's Hamlet. First of all,
says the reviewer, Isaachson labors under the delusion that every
line is cryptic, embodying a secret. This leads him to forget the
volume of the part and to invent all sorts of fanciful interpretations
for details. Thus he loses the unity of the character. Things
are hurried through to a conclusion and the fine transitions are
lost. For example, "Oh, that this too, too solid flesh would melt"
is started well, but the speech at once gains in clearness and decision
until one wonders at the close why such a Hamlet does not
act at once with promptness and vigor. There are, to be sure,
occasional excellences, but they do not conceal the fact that, as
a whole, Isaachson does not understand Hamlet.</p>

<p>Since its first performance <i>Hamlet</i> has been given often in
Norway&mdash;twenty-eight times at the old Christiania Theater, and
(from October 31, 1907) seventeen times at the new National
Theater. Its revival in 1907, after an intermission of twenty-four
years, was a complete success, although
<i>Morgenbladet</i><a name = "tag3_20"
href = "#note3_20"><sup>III.20</sup></a> complained
<span class = "pagenum">104</span>
that the performance lacked light and inspiration. The
house was full and the audience appreciative.</p>

<p><i>Aftenposten</i><a name = "tag3_21"
href = "#note3_21"><sup>III.21</sup></a>
found the production admirable. Christensen's
Hamlet was a stroke of genius. "Han er voxet i og med Rollen;
han har trængt sig ind i den danske Prins' dybeste Individualitet."
And of the revival the paper says: "The performance
shows that a national theater can solve difficult problems when the
effort is made with sympathy, joy, and devotion to art."</p>

<p>In my judgment no theater could have given a better
<ins class = "correction" title = "spelling as in original">caste</ins>
for <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> than that with which Christiania
Theater was provided. All the actors were artists of distinction;
and it is not strange, therefore, that the first performance was a
huge success.
<i>Aftenposten</i><a name = "tag3_22"
href = "#note3_22"><sup>III.22</sup></a>
declares that Brun's Falstaff was a revelation.
<i>Morgenbladet</i><a name = "tag3_23"
href = "#note3_23"><sup>III.23</sup></a>
says that the play was done only moderately well.
Brun as Falstaff was, however, "especially amusing."
<i>Aftenbladet</i><a name = "tag3_24"
href = "#note3_24"><sup>III.24</sup></a>
is more generous. "<i>The Merry Wives of
Windsor</i> has been awaited with a good deal of interest. Next
to the curiosity about the play itself, the chief attraction has been
Brun as Falstaff. And though Falstaff as lover gives no such
opportunities as Falstaff, the mock hero, Brun makes a notable
rôle out of it because he knows how to seize upon and bring out all
there is in it."</p>

<p>Johannes Brun's Falstaff is a classic to this day on the Norwegian
stage. In <i>Illustreret Tidende</i> for July 12, 1874, K.A. Winterhjelm
has a short appreciation of his work. "Johannes Brun has,
as nearly as we can estimate, played something like three hundred
rôles at Christiania Theater. Many of them, to be sure, are
minor parts&mdash;but there remains a goodly number of important
ones, from the clown in the farce to the chief parts in the great
comedies. Merely to enumerate his great successes would carry
us far afield. We recall in passing that he has given us Falstaff
both in <i>Henry IV</i> and in <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>,
Bottom in <i>A&nbsp;Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, and Autolycus in
<i>A&nbsp;Winter's Tale</i>.
Perhaps he lacks something of the nobleman we feel that he should
be in <i>Henry IV</i>, but aside from this petty criticism, what a
wondrous comic character Brun has given us!"</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">105</span>
As to the success of <i>Coriolanus</i>, the sixteenth of Shakespeare's
plays to be put on in Kristiania, neither the newspapers nor the
magazines give us any clew. If we may believe a little puff in
<i>Aftenposten</i> for January 20, 1874, the staging was to be
magnificent. <i>Coriolanus</i> was played in a translation by Hartvig
Lassen for the first time on January 21, 1874. After thirteen
performances it was withdrawn on January 10, 1876, and has not been
since presented.</p>

<p>In 1877, <i>Richard III</i> was brought on the boards for the first
time, but apparently the occasion was not considered significant,
for there is scarcely a notice of it. The public seemed surfeited
with Shakespeare, although the average had been less than one
Shakespearean play a season. At all events, it was ten years
before the theater put on a new one&mdash;<i>Julius Caesar</i>, on March
22, 1888. It had the unheard of distinction of being acted sixteen
times in one month, from the premiere night to April 22. Yet
the papers passed it by with indifference. Most of them gave it
merely a notice, and the promised review in <i>Aftenposten</i> never
appeared.</p>

<p><i>Julius Caesar</i> is the last new play to be presented at
Christiania Theater or at the National Theater, which replaced the
old Christiania Theater in 1899. From October, 1899 to January,
1913 the National Theater has presented eight Shakespearean
plays, but every one of them has been a revival of plays previously
presented.</p>
<br>
<p align = "center"><i>Bergen</i></p>

<p>Up to a few years ago, the only theater of consequence in
Norway, outside of the capital, was at Bergen. In many respects
the history of the theater at Bergen is more interesting than that of
the theater at Christiania. Established in 1850, while Christiania
Theater was still largely Danish, to foster Norwegian
dramatic art, it is associated with the greatest names in Norwegian
art and letters. The theater owes its origin mainly to Ole Bull;
Henrik Ibsen was official playwright from 1851 to 1857, and
Bjørnson was director from 1857 to 1859. For a dozen years or
more "Den Nationale Scene i Bergen" led a precarious existence
and finally closed its doors in 1863. In 1876 the theater was
reopened. During the first period only two Shakespearean plays
were given&mdash;<i>Twelfth Night</i> and <i>As You Like It</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<i>As You Like It</i> in Stille Beyer's version was played twice
during the season 1855-56, on September 30 and October 3. The
press is silent about the performances, but doubtless we may accept
Blanc's statement that the task was too severe for the Bergen
theater.<a name = "tag3_25" href = "#note3_25"><sup>III.25</sup></a></p>

<p>Rather more successful were the two performances of <i>Twelfth
Night</i> in a stage version adapted from the German of Deinhardstein.
The celebrated Laura Svendsen played the double rôle
of Sebastian-Viola with conspicuous success.<a name = "tag3_26"
href = "#note3_26"><sup>III.26</sup></a></p>

<p><i>The Merchant of Venice</i> was given for the first time on October
9, 1878, two years after the reopening of the theater. <i>Bergens
Tidende</i><a name = "tag3_27" href = "#note3_27"><sup>III.27</sup></a>
calls the production "a creditable piece of amateur
theatricals," insisting in a review of some length that the young
theater cannot measure up to the demands which a play of Shakespeare's
makes. <i>Bergensposten</i> is less severe. Though far from
faultless, the presentation was creditable, in some details excellent.
But, quite apart from its absolute merits, there is great satisfaction
in seeing the theater undertake plays that are worth
while.<a name = "tag3_28" href = "#note3_28"><sup>III.28</sup></a>
Both papers agree that the audience was large and enthusiastic.</p>

<p>The next season <i>A&nbsp;Winter's Tale</i> was given in H.P. Holst's
translation and adaptation of Dingelstedt's German acting version
<i>Ein Wintermärchen</i>. The press greeted it enthusiastically.
<i>Bergens Tidende</i><a name = "tag3_29"
href = "#note3_29"><sup>III.29</sup></a>
says: "<i>A&nbsp;Winter's Tale</i> was performed at our
theater yesterday in a manner that won the enthusiastic applause
of a large gathering. The principal actors were called before the
curtain again and again. It is greatly to the credit of any theater
to give a Shakespeare drama, and all the more so when it can do it
in a form as artistically perfect as was yesterday's presentation."</p>

<p>Concerning <i>Othello</i>, third in order in the Shakespearean
repertoire in Bergen, the reviews of the first performance, November
13, 1881, are conflicting. <i>Bergens Tidende</i><a name = "tag3_30"
href = "#note3_30"><sup>III.30</sup></a> is all praise. It has no
hesitation in pronouncing Johannesen's Iago a masterpiece.
<i>Bergensposten</i><a name = "tag3_31"
href = "#note3_31"><sup>III.31</sup></a>
calls the performance passable but utterly damns
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
Johannesen&mdash;"nothing short of a colossal blunder." Hr. Johannesen
is commended to the easily accessible commentaries of Taine and
<ins class = "correction" title = "original reads 'Genèe'">Genée</ins>,
and to Hamlet's speech to the players. Desdemona
and Cassio are dismissed in much the same fashion.</p>

<p>A few days later, November 18, <i>Bergensposten</i> reviewed the
performance again and was glad to note a great improvement.</p>

<p><i>Bergens <ins class = "correction"
title = "spelling as in original">Addressecontoirs</ins>
Efterretninger</i><a name = "tag3_32"
href = "#note3_32"><sup>III.32</sup></a>
agrees with <i>Bergensposten</i>
in its estimate of Johannesen. "He gives us only the
villain in Iago, not the cunning Ensign who deceives so many."
But Desdemona was thoroughly satisfying.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been its initial success, <i>Othello</i> did not
last. It was given four times during the season 1881-2, but was
then dropped and has never since been taken up.</p>

<p>Three different groups of <i>Hamlet</i> performances have been
given in Bergen. In September, 1883, the Ophelia scenes from
Act IV were given; the complete play, however, was not given till
November 28, 1886. The press,<a name = "tag3_33"
href = "#note3_33"><sup>III.33</sup></a>
for once, was unanimous in
declaring the production a success. It is interesting that an
untried actor at his debut was entrusted with the rôle. But, to
judge from the press comments, Hr. Løchen more than justified
the confidence in him. His interpretation of the subtlest character
in Shakespeare was thoroughly satisfying.<a name = "tag3_34"
href = "#note3_34"><sup>III.34</sup></a></p>

<p>Finally, it should be noted that a Swedish travelling company
under the direction of the well-known August Lindberg played
<i>Hamlet</i> in Bergen on November 5, 1895.</p>

<p>It is apparent, from the tone of the press comment that a
Shakespearean production was regarded as a serious undertaking.
The theater approached the task hesitatingly, and the newspapers
always qualify their praise or their blame with some apologetic
remark about "the limited resources of our theater." This
explains the long gaps between new productions, five years between
<i>Othello</i> (1881) and the complete <i>Hamlet</i> (1886);
five years likewise between <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>King Henry IV</i>.</p>

<p><i>Henry IV</i> in Bjørnson's stage cutting promised at first to
establish itself. Its first performance was greeted by a crowded
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
house, and enthusiasm ran high. The press questions the right
of the play to the title of <i>Henry IV</i>, since it is a collection of
scenes
grouped about Prince Hal and Falstaff. But aside from this purely
objective criticism the comment is favorable.<a name = "tag3_35"
href = "#note3_35"><sup>III.35</sup></a></p>

<p>With the second performance (March 4, 1891) comes a change.
<i>Bergens Tidende</i> remarks that it is a common experience that a
second performance is not so successful as the first. Certainly
this was true in the case of <i>Henry IV</i>. The life and sparkle were
gone, and the sallies of Falstaff awakened no such infectious
laughter as they had a few evenings
before.<a name = "tag3_36" href = "#note3_36"><sup>III.36</sup></a>
There was no applause from the crowded house, and the coolness of the
audience reacted upon the players&mdash;all in violent contrast to the
first performance. The reviewer in <i>Aftenbladet</i> predicts that the
production will have no very long life.<a name = "tag3_37"
href = "#note3_37"><sup>III.37</sup></a>
He was right. It was given once more, on March 6. Since then the
theater-goers of Bergen have not seen it on their own stage.</p>

<p>Sille Beyer's <i>Viola</i> (which, in turn, is an adaptation of the
German of Deinhardstein) had been played twice at the old Bergen
Theater, July 17 and 18, 1861. It was now (Oct. 9, 1892)
revived in a new cutting based on Lembcke's Danish translation.
<i>Bergens Aftenblad</i> declares that the cutting was reckless and the
staging almost beggarly. The presentation itself hardly rose
above the mediocre.<a name = "tag3_38"
href = "#note3_38"><sup>III.38</sup></a>
<i>Bergens Tidende</i>, on the other hand,
reports that the performance was an entire success. The
<ins class = "correction" title = "spelling as in original">caste</ins>
was unexpectedly strong; the costumes and scenery splendid.
The audience was appreciative and there was generous applause.<a name =
"tag3_39" href = "#note3_39"><sup>III.39</sup></a></p>

<p>The last new play to find a place on the repertoire at Bergen
is <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. This was performed four times in May,
1897. Like <i>Henry IV</i>, it promised to be a great success, but it
survived only four performances.
<i>Bergens Tidende</i><a name = "tag3_40"
href = "#note3_40"><sup>III.40</sup></a>
gives a careful,
well-written analysis of the play and of the presentation. The
reviewer gives full credit for the beauty of the staging and the
excellence of the acting, but criticises the censor sharply for the
unskillful cutting, and the stage manager for the long, tiresome
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
waits. <i>Bergens Aftenblad</i><a name = "tag3_41"
href = "#note3_41"><sup>III.41</sup></a>
praises the performance almost without reserve.</p>

<p>And the last chapter in the history of Shakespeare's dramas
in Bergen is a revival of <i>A&nbsp;Winter's Tale</i> in the season 1902-3.
The theater had done its utmost to give a spendid and worthy
setting, and great care was given to the rehearsals. The result
was a performance which, for beauty, symmetry, and artistic
unity ranks among the very best that have ever been seen at the
theater. The press was unanimous in its cordial
recognition.<a name = "tag3_42" href = "#note3_42"><sup>III.42</sup></a>
The play was given no less than nine times during October, 1902.
Since then Shakespeare has not been given at <i>Den Nationale
Scene i Bergen</i>.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
